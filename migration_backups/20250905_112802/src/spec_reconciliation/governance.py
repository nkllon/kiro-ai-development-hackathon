## Overview

This governance framework ensures ongoing spec consistency and prevents fragmentation through systematic procedures, clear roles, and continuous improvement processes.

## Governance Principles

### 1. Prevention First
- Implement controls to prevent spec fragmentation before it occurs
- Mandatory validation for all spec changes
- Automated consistency checking in CI/CD pipelines

### 2. Clear Accountability
- Defined roles with specific responsibilities
- Clear approval authorities and escalation paths
- Measurable performance criteria

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Regular review and optimization of governance processes
- Data-driven decision making
- Stakeholder feedback integration

### 4. Automation Where Possible
- Automated validation and monitoring
- Self-healing systems for common issues
- Minimal manual intervention required
