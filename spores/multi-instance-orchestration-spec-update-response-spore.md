## ðŸš€ Enhanced Spec Components

### New Requirement 22: Distributed Message Bus
```markdown
**User Story:** As a distributed system architect, I want a scalable pub/sub 
message bus to replace spore-based communication so that the system can handle 
production-scale inter-instance coordination with proper reliability and 
performance guarantees.

**Key Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automatic transition from spores to message bus based on usage patterns
- Support for Redis, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and NATS evaluation
- Backward compatibility with existing message formats
- Graceful degradation back to spores as fallback mechanism
```

### Enhanced Design Architecture
**Communication Infrastructure Evolution:**
- **Current**: Spore-based file communication for discovery
- **Production**: Scalable pub/sub based on discovered patterns
- **Selection Criteria**: Volume, latency, reliability, scaling, operational complexity
- **Fallback Strategy**: Automatic degradation to spores for resilience

### New Implementation Tasks
**Task 15.1**: Message bus evaluation and selection framework
**Task 15.2**: Message bus abstraction layer and migration system

Both tasks focus on systematic evaluation and seamless transition while maintaining the proven StructuredAction/ActionResult message format compatibility.
