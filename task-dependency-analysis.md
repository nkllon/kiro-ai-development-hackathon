## Recursive Descent Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Parallel Execution (Tier 0)
Execute these 7 tasks in parallel immediately:
```
PARALLEL_BATCH_1 = [
    "2.1 - Implement Logging Issue Detection and Repair",
    "2.2 - Create Robust Test Logging System", 
    "3.1 - Add Missing Optimization Methods",
    "3.2 - Implement Comprehensive Analytics Methods",
    "3.3 - Fix Tool Execution Behavior Validation",
    "4.1 - Implement Accurate Health State Tracking",
    "1.1 - Implement Enhanced RCA Engine Core"
]
```

### Phase 2: First Dependencies (Tier 1)
When Tier 0 completes, execute these in parallel:
```
PARALLEL_BATCH_2 = [
    "1.2 - Add Failure Pattern Recognition System" (after 1.1),
    "1.3 - Implement Context-Aware Analysis" (after 1.1),
    "4.2 - Fix Component Health Check Methods" (after 4.1)
]

SEQUENTIAL_BATCH_2 = [
    "2 - Fix Test Infrastructure Logging Issues" (after 2.1, 2.2),
    "3 - Implement Missing Tool Orchestration Methods" (after 3.1, 3.2, 3.3),
    "4 - Enhance Health Check Accuracy" (after 4.1, 4.2)
]
```

### Phase 3: Core System Assembly (Tier 2)
```
PARALLEL_BATCH_3 = [
    "1 - Enhance RCA Engine with Intelligent Analysis" (after 1.1, 1.2, 1.3),
    "5.1 - Implement Automated RCA Triggering" (after 1),
    "5.2 - Create Failure Categorization System" (after 1.2)
]
```

### Execution Algorithm

```python
def execute_tasks_with_dependencies():
    completed_tasks = set()
    
    def can_execute(task_id, dependencies):
        return all(dep in completed_tasks for dep in dependencies)
    
    def recursive_execute(tier_tasks):
        ready_tasks = []
        
        for task_id, dependencies in tier_tasks.items():
            if can_execute(task_id, dependencies):
                ready_tasks.append(task_id)
        
        if ready_tasks:
            # Execute ready tasks in parallel
            execute_parallel(ready_tasks)
            
            # Mark as completed
            completed_tasks.update(ready_tasks)
            
            # Remove completed tasks from remaining tiers
            remaining_tasks = {
                tid: deps for tid, deps in tier_tasks.items() 
                if tid not in completed_tasks
            }
            
            if remaining_tasks:
                # Recursively process remaining tasks
                recursive_execute(remaining_tasks)
    
    # Start with all tasks and their dependencies
    all_tasks = get_task_dependency_map()
    recursive_execute(all_tasks)
```

## Optimal Execution Order

### Critical Path Analysis
The critical path (longest dependency chain) is:
`1.1 → 1.2 → 5.2 → 7.1 → 7.3 → 8.2 → 8 → 9.2 → 9 → 10.2 → 10`

**Critical Path Length: 10 tiers**

### Parallelization Opportunities
- **Tier 0**: 7 tasks can run in parallel
- **Tier 1**: 3 tasks can run in parallel after their dependencies
- **Maximum Concurrency**: Up to 7 agents can work simultaneously in early phases

### Resource Allocation Strategy
1. **High Priority Agents**: Assign to critical path tasks (1.1, 1.2, 5.2, 7.1, 7.3)
2. **Medium Priority Agents**: Assign to parallel foundation tasks (2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2)
3. **Support Agents**: Assign to testing and documentation tasks

This DAG ensures optimal task execution with maximum parallelization while respecting all dependencies.
