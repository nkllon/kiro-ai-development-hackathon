# üß¨ **RM & RDI Implementation Analysis & Recommendations Prompt**

## üìã **Context & Background**

You are analyzing the OpenFlow Playground project's implementation of two critical architectural systems:

1. **RM (Reflective Module)** - A foundational architectural pattern ensuring self-aware, self-monitoring components
2. **RDI (Requirements‚ÜíDesign‚ÜíImplementation‚ÜíDocumentation)** - A systematic development methodology ensuring complete traceability

Both systems are fully implemented and operational, but require analysis for optimization and future enhancement opportunities.
