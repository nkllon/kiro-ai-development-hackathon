## Next Phase Readiness

The reconciled specifications are now ready for:

1. **Task 2.3**: Commit and Push Operations (requirements and design ready)
2. **Task 3.1**: GitConfigurationManager (requirements and design ready)
3. **Task 4.1**: GitKrakenProvider (requirements and design ready)
4. **Integration Tasks**: Beast Mode integration (requirements and design ready)

## Conclusion

✅ **COMPLETE RECONCILIATION ACHIEVED**

All three specification documents (Requirements, Design, Tasks) have been fully reconciled with implementation findings. The specifications now accurately reflect:

- **What was discovered** during implementation
- **What was actually built** vs originally planned  
- **What needs to be built** in future phases
- **How everything traces together** from requirements to implementation

This reconciliation ensures that future development phases have accurate, implementation-validated specifications to work from, reducing the risk of specification-implementation drift and improving development velocity.
