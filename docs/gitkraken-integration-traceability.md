## Requirements Evolution

### Original Requirements Gaps Identified

During implementation, we discovered several capabilities that weren't covered in the original requirements:

1. **Advanced Branch Analysis** (Added as Requirement 10)
   - Branch comparison and relationship analysis
   - Detailed branch metadata extraction
   - Upstream branch management

2. **Performance Monitoring** (Added as Requirement 11)
   - Execution time tracking for all operations
   - Provider health status monitoring
   - Performance optimization insights

3. **Enhanced Validation** (Added as Requirement 12)
   - Comprehensive branch name validation
   - Commit message formatting
   - Git protocol compliance checking

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling** (Added as Requirement 13)
   - Specific error codes for programmatic handling
   - Actionable suggestions with context
   - Multi-level error recovery strategies

### Requirements Updates Made

1. **Requirement 2**: Enhanced to include comprehensive branch operations
2. **Requirement 4**: Expanded to include health monitoring and structured data
3. **Added Requirements 10-13**: Cover discovered implementation needs

## Next Implementation Priorities

Based on the traceability analysis, the next priorities should be:

1. **GitKraken Provider Implementation** (Req 1, 6)
2. **Commit and Push Operations** (Req 3)
3. **Beast Mode Integration** (Req 5)
4. **Complete Fallback Mechanisms** (Req 7)

## Validation

All implemented features have been validated through:
- ✅ Unit tests with mocked dependencies
- ✅ Integration tests with real git repositories
- ✅ Error scenario testing
- ✅ Performance validation
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility testing

This traceability matrix ensures that all implemented features are properly justified by requirements and that no requirements are left unaddressed in the implementation plan.
