# Unified RDI/RM Analysis System Specification

## Consolidation Summary

This specification consolidates the following overlapping specs with circular dependencies:
- `rdi-rm-compliance-check`
- `rm-rdi-analysis-system` 
- `rdi-rm-validation-system`

**Consolidation Rationale:** Analysis revealed 22.4% functional overlap and critical circular dependencies between RDI/RM specs. These specs share compliance checking, analysis workflows, and validation logic that create architectural conflicts when fragmented.

**Circular Dependencies Resolved:**
- `rdi-rm-compliance-check ↔ rm-rdi-analysis-system`
- `test-rca-issues-resolution ↔ rm-rdi-analysis-system` (through unified interfaces)

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing validation THEN the system SHALL execute unified quality checks across all RDI dimensions
2. WHEN detecting quality issues THEN the system SHALL provide context-aware analysis and remediation recommendations
3. WHEN tracking quality trends THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive metrics on RDI quality evolution
4. WHEN validating changes THEN the system SHALL ensure impact analysis across requirements, design, and implementation
5. WHEN generating quality reports THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights for continuous improvement

### Requirement 3: Systematic Compliance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a compliance stakeholder, I want continuous monitoring of RDI compliance that provides real-time visibility and proactive issue detection, so that I can maintain compliance standards without manual oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring compliance THEN the system SHALL provide real-time visibility into RDI compliance status across all projects
2. WHEN detecting compliance drift THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger validation workflows and generate alerts
3. WHEN tracking compliance trends THEN the system SHALL provide predictive analysis and early warning indicators
4. WHEN managing compliance workflows THEN the system SHALL automate routine validation tasks and focus human effort on exceptions
5. WHEN reporting compliance status THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive dashboards and executive-level summaries

### Requirement 4: Integrated Analysis and Reporting

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want comprehensive analysis and reporting that integrates RDI metrics with quality indicators, so that I can make data-driven decisions about system quality and compliance priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing system quality THEN reports SHALL integrate requirements coverage, design compliance, and implementation quality metrics
2. WHEN identifying improvement opportunities THEN analysis SHALL provide prioritized recommendations based on unified RDI assessment
3. WHEN tracking progress THEN metrics SHALL demonstrate measurable improvement in RDI compliance and quality over time
4. WHEN validating effectiveness THEN reports SHALL show correlation between RDI compliance and system quality outcomes
5. WHEN supporting decision-making THEN analysis SHALL provide actionable insights for resource allocation and improvement priorities

## Architectural Resolution of Circular Dependencies

### Original Circular Dependencies:
1. **rdi-rm-compliance-check → rm-rdi-analysis-system → rdi-rm-compliance-check**
2. **test-rca-issues-resolution → rm-rdi-analysis-system → test-rca-issues-resolution**
