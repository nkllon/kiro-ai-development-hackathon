## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **TaskExecutionEngine**: Main orchestration engine with recursive descent logic
2. **Task**: Data structure representing individual work items with dependencies
3. **Agent**: Represents available workers with specific capabilities
4. **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for system interaction

### Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class Task:
    id: str
    name: str
    description: str
    dependencies: List[str]
    status: TaskStatus
    estimated_duration_hours: float
    priority: int
    requirements: List[str]

@dataclass
class Agent:
    id: str
    name: str
    is_available: bool
    capabilities: List[str]
    max_concurrent_tasks: int
```

### Execution Algorithm
```python
def recursive_task_execution():
    while tasks_remaining():
        ready_tasks = get_tasks_with_met_dependencies()
        available_agents = get_available_agents()
        
        for task in ready_tasks:
            if available_agents:
                best_agent = find_best_agent_for_task(task)
                assign_task_to_agent(task, best_agent)
        
        wait_for_task_completions()
        update_dependency_graph()
```

## 📊 Optimization Opportunities

### Parallelization Analysis
- **Current Max Parallelism**: 7 tasks (Tier 0)
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Single tasks in Tier 5 create sequential bottleneck
- **Optimization Potential**: Could restructure some Tier 4-5 dependencies for better parallelism

### Resource Allocation
- **Agent Specialization**: Matching agent capabilities to task requirements improves efficiency
- **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of work across available agents
- **Priority Handling**: High-priority tasks (priority=1) get preferential assignment
