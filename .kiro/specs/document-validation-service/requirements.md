# Document Validation Service Requirements

## Introduction

The Document Validation Service provides focused document structure validation, format compliance checking, and template validation for specification documents. This service has a single responsibility: ensuring documents follow proper structure, format, and content standards without any orchestration, analysis, or recovery concerns.

**Single Responsibility:** Document structure and format validation only
**Architectural Position:** Foundational service with no dependencies

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Structure Validation

**User Story:** As a document management system, I want to validate document structure compliance, so that all documents follow consistent organizational standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is submitted for validation THEN the service SHALL verify required sections (Introduction, Requirements, etc.) are present
2. WHEN document hierarchy is checked THEN the service SHALL validate proper heading structure and numbering
3. WHEN section content is analyzed THEN the service SHALL verify each section contains required elements
4. WHEN validation completes THEN the service SHALL return detailed structure compliance results
5. WHEN structure violations are found THEN the service SHALL provide specific remediation guidance

### Requirement 2: EARS Format Validation

**User Story:** As a document management system, I want to validate EARS format compliance in requirements, so that acceptance criteria follow systematic standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are validated THEN the service SHALL verify EARS format (WHEN/THEN/SHALL structure)
2. WHEN acceptance criteria are checked THEN the service SHALL validate proper conditional logic patterns
3. WHEN EARS violations are detected THEN the service SHALL provide specific format correction guidance
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the service SHALL confirm EARS compliance with confidence scores
5. WHEN edge cases occur THEN the service SHALL handle complex EARS patterns appropriately

### Requirement 3: Template Compliance Checking

**User Story:** As a document management system, I want to validate template compliance, so that documents follow established organizational formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are validated THEN the service SHALL check compliance against defined templates
2. WHEN template violations occur THEN the service SHALL identify specific non-compliant elements
3. WHEN multiple templates exist THEN the service SHALL validate against the appropriate template type
4. WHEN compliance is verified THEN the service SHALL provide template conformance certificates
5. WHEN templates evolve THEN the service SHALL support versioned template validation

### Requirement 4: Content Quality Validation

**User Story:** As a document management system, I want to validate content quality standards, so that documents meet professional documentation requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is analyzed THEN the service SHALL validate completeness of required information
2. WHEN quality checks run THEN the service SHALL verify clarity, consistency, and professional standards
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN the service SHALL provide specific improvement recommendations
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the service SHALL issue quality compliance certificates
5. WHEN standards change THEN the service SHALL adapt validation criteria accordingly

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are validated THEN validation SHALL complete within 2 seconds for documents up to 10,000 words
2. WHEN concurrent validations occur THEN the service SHALL handle 50+ simultaneous validation requests
3. WHEN large documents are processed THEN memory usage SHALL remain under 100MB per validation
4. WHEN validation load increases THEN response times SHALL degrade gracefully
5. WHEN performance targets are exceeded THEN the service SHALL provide appropriate feedback

### Derived Requirement 2: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation requests are made THEN the service SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the service SHALL fail gracefully without data corruption
3. WHEN invalid input is received THEN the service SHALL handle errors appropriately
4. WHEN service restarts THEN validation state SHALL be preserved appropriately
5. WHEN load spikes occur THEN the service SHALL maintain core functionality
