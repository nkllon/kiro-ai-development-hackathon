# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current project has a sophisticated domain architecture with 100+ domains across multiple categories (demo_core, demo_tools, demo_infrastructure, etc.), but lacks a comprehensive indexing and modeling system. The existing `project_model_registry.json` contains extensive domain information, but there's no systematic way to query, analyze, or maintain domain relationships. The makefile system in `makefiles/` provides operational capabilities but needs better integration with the domain model. This feature will create a comprehensive domain index and model system that provides intelligent querying, relationship analysis, and automated maintenance of the domain architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query domain information intelligently, so that I can understand domain relationships, dependencies, and capabilities without manually parsing large JSON files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query for a domain by name THEN the system SHALL return complete domain information including patterns, dependencies, and metadata
2. WHEN I search for domains by capability or pattern THEN the system SHALL return all matching domains with relevance scoring
3. WHEN I request domain relationships THEN the system SHALL provide dependency graphs and impact analysis
4. IF a domain has extraction potential THEN the system SHALL highlight PyPI packaging opportunities
5. WHEN I query cross-domain patterns THEN the system SHALL identify common patterns and potential consolidation opportunities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want automated domain health monitoring, so that I can identify broken dependencies, orphaned domains, and architectural inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs health checks THEN it SHALL validate all domain dependencies exist and are accessible
2. WHEN domain patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify orphaned files not covered by any domain
3. WHEN dependency cycles are detected THEN the system SHALL report circular dependencies with resolution suggestions
4. IF domain requirements conflict THEN the system SHALL flag inconsistencies and suggest resolutions
5. WHEN makefile targets are analyzed THEN the system SHALL ensure all domains have corresponding build operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated domain model synchronization, so that the domain registry stays current with actual project structure and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new files are added to the project THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate domain assignments
2. WHEN domain patterns change THEN the system SHALL update the registry automatically or prompt for confirmation
3. WHEN domains are refactored THEN the system SHALL update all dependent references and relationships
4. IF domain extraction occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain traceability and update dependency mappings
5. WHEN makefile operations change THEN the system SHALL synchronize domain operational capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent domain discovery and classification, so that I can understand how new code fits into the existing architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a file path or code snippet THEN the system SHALL identify the most appropriate domain(s)
2. WHEN analyzing code patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest domain improvements or consolidations
3. WHEN new domains are needed THEN the system SHALL recommend domain structure based on existing patterns
4. IF domain boundaries are unclear THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on proper domain separation
5. WHEN domain capabilities overlap THEN the system SHALL suggest refactoring opportunities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a build system maintainer, I want integrated makefile and domain operations, so that build targets align with domain architecture and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domains are queried THEN the system SHALL show available makefile operations for each domain
2. WHEN makefile targets are executed THEN the system SHALL validate domain health and dependencies first
3. WHEN new domains are added THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate makefile targets automatically
4. IF domain operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN domain extraction occurs THEN the system SHALL update makefile targets to reflect new structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want domain metrics and analytics, so that I can understand domain usage patterns, complexity, and evolution over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting domain analytics THEN the system SHALL provide complexity metrics, file counts, and dependency depth
2. WHEN analyzing domain evolution THEN the system SHALL track changes over time and identify trends
3. WHEN evaluating extraction candidates THEN the system SHALL provide scoring based on reusability and independence
4. IF domains show high coupling THEN the system SHALL suggest decoupling strategies
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide visualizations of domain relationships and health status
