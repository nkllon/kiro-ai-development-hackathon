# Spec Consistency and Technical Debt Reconciliation Requirements

## Introduction

The current project has 14 different specs with overlapping functionality, inconsistent terminology, and fragmented implementation approaches. This creates significant technical debt through duplicated requirements, conflicting design decisions, and scattered implementation efforts. 

**Root Cause Analysis:** This fragmentation occurred due to lack of governance controls, absence of consistency validation, and no preventive mechanisms to detect overlapping functionality during spec creation.

**PCOR (Preventive Corrective Action Request) Approach:** This feature will not only reconcile existing specs but implement systematic prevention mechanisms to ensure this fragmentation cannot reoccur. The solution includes automated governance, mandatory consistency validation, and continuous monitoring to maintain architectural integrity.

This feature will systematically reconcile all specs to create a unified, consistent architecture that eliminates redundancy and provides clear implementation guidance, while implementing preventive controls to maintain consistency over time.

## Stakeholder Personas

### Primary Stakeholder: "System Architect" (Technical Debt Eliminator)
**Role:** Responsible for architectural consistency and technical debt reduction
**Goals:**
- Eliminate duplicate and conflicting requirements across specs
- Create unified terminology and consistent design patterns
- Establish clear boundaries between system components
- Reduce implementation complexity through consolidation

**Pain Points:**
- Multiple specs define overlapping functionality (Beast Mode Framework vs Integrated Beast Mode System)
- Inconsistent terminology across specs (RM vs RDI vs Domain Intelligence)
- Fragmented implementation approaches leading to code duplication
- Unclear component boundaries causing integration issues

**Success Criteria:**
- Single source of truth for each system capability
- Consistent terminology and design patterns across all specs
- Clear component boundaries with well-defined interfaces
- Reduced implementation complexity and code duplication

### Secondary Stakeholder: "Development Team" (Implementation Efficiency)
**Role:** Engineers implementing the reconciled specifications
**Goals:**
- Clear, non-conflicting requirements for implementation
- Consistent patterns and interfaces across components
- Reduced cognitive load from simplified architecture
- Efficient implementation without redundant work

**Pain Points:**
- Conflicting requirements between different specs
- Unclear which spec takes precedence for overlapping functionality
- Inconsistent interface definitions across related components
- Wasted effort implementing duplicate functionality

**Success Criteria:**
- Single, authoritative spec for each component or capability
- Consistent interface patterns across all components
- Clear implementation priorities and dependencies
- Elimination of redundant implementation work
