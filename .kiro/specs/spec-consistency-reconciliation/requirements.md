# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current project has 14 different specs with overlapping functionality, inconsistent terminology, and fragmented implementation approaches. This creates significant technical debt through duplicated requirements, conflicting design decisions, and scattered implementation efforts. 

This feature will systematically reconcile all specs to create a unified, consistent architecture that eliminates redundancy and provides clear implementation guidance, while implementing preventive controls to maintain consistency over time through automated governance, mandatory consistency validation, and continuous monitoring to maintain architectural integrity.
