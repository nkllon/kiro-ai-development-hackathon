## Notes

This research CMA system represents a **hybrid build/leverage approach** that maximizes value while minimizing risk. By building the unique research methodology layer on top of proven OSS foundations, we get enterprise-grade reliability with custom research workflow capabilities.

The key insight - leveraging OSS for infrastructure while building custom research intelligence - follows the same "systematic superiority" principle that drives Beast Mode development. We're not reinventing content management; we're systematically enhancing it for breakthrough research methodology.
