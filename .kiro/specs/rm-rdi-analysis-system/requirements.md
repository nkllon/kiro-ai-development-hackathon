# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RM-RDI Analysis and Optimization System is a comprehensive analysis and improvement framework designed to evaluate, monitor, and optimize the existing RM (Reflective Module) and RDI (Requirements→Design→Implementation→Documentation) systems within the OpenFlow Playground project. This system will provide automated analysis, actionable recommendations, and continuous monitoring capabilities to ensure both systems maintain high quality, performance, and compliance standards as the project scales.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want automated analysis of RM and RDI system architecture, so that I can identify strengths, weaknesses, and optimization opportunities without manual code review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis system is executed THEN it SHALL analyze all RM-compliant modules and generate an architecture assessment report
2. WHEN analyzing RDI compliance THEN the system SHALL validate the complete Requirements→Design→Implementation→Documentation traceability chain
3. WHEN architecture analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify integration quality between RM and RDI systems
4. WHEN scalability assessment is performed THEN the system SHALL evaluate how well systems will scale as the project grows
5. IF architectural weaknesses are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and impact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want automated code quality assessment for RM and RDI implementations, so that I can maintain high code standards and identify technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code quality assessment runs THEN the system SHALL evaluate maintainability metrics for all RM and RDI components
2. WHEN analyzing testability THEN the system SHALL assess test coverage and identify gaps in validation
3. WHEN performance analysis is executed THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and performance characteristics
4. WHEN security assessment runs THEN the system SHALL evaluate security considerations in current implementations
5. IF files exceed 200-line limits THEN the system SHALL flag them as size violations with refactoring recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automated compliance and standards validation, so that I can ensure RM and RDI systems follow established methodologies and project standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RM compliance check runs THEN the system SHALL validate adherence to RM principles across all modules
2. WHEN RDI methodology validation executes THEN the system SHALL verify proper Requirements→Design→Implementation→Documentation flow
3. WHEN project standards check runs THEN the system SHALL evaluate code against established coding standards
4. WHEN industry best practices assessment executes THEN the system SHALL compare implementation against recognized patterns
5. IF compliance violations are found THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technical debt manager, I want comprehensive technical debt analysis, so that I can prioritize refactoring efforts and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical debt analysis runs THEN the system SHALL identify all files exceeding size limits with impact assessment
2. WHEN refactoring needs assessment executes THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical refactoring opportunities
3. WHEN performance debt analysis runs THEN the system SHALL identify performance optimization needs with effort estimates
4. WHEN documentation debt check executes THEN the system SHALL identify documentation gaps and inconsistencies
5. IF technical debt exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with recommended action plans

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want actionable improvement recommendations with priority rankings, so that I can make informed decisions about development resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN improvement analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate immediate improvements ranked by priority
2. WHEN short-term planning runs THEN the system SHALL provide 1-3 month enhancement roadmap with effort estimates
3. WHEN long-term strategy analysis executes THEN the system SHALL generate 3-12 month strategic improvement plan
4. WHEN risk assessment runs THEN the system SHALL identify technical, operational, and scalability risks with mitigation strategies
5. IF critical issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for immediate attention with escalation procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want continuous monitoring and metrics collection, so that I can track system health and improvement progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system runs THEN it SHALL collect performance metrics for RM and RDI systems
2. WHEN quality metrics collection executes THEN the system SHALL track code quality trends over time
3. WHEN compliance monitoring runs THEN the system SHALL track RM and RDI compliance metrics continuously
4. WHEN business value assessment executes THEN the system SHALL measure delivered value through established metrics
5. IF metrics indicate degradation THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and generate improvement recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with existing development workflows, so that analysis and recommendations are seamlessly incorporated into my daily development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrated with CI/CD pipeline THEN the system SHALL provide automated analysis on code changes
2. WHEN integrated with Makefile system THEN the system SHALL provide make targets for all analysis functions
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL output results in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML)
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL integrate findings with existing project documentation
5. IF analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery procedures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want automated refactoring recommendations and implementation guidance, so that I can efficiently address identified technical debt and optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring analysis runs THEN the system SHALL generate specific refactoring strategies for oversized files
2. WHEN optimization opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL provide implementation guidance with code examples
3. WHEN architectural improvements are recommended THEN the system SHALL provide migration paths and impact assessments
4. WHEN performance optimizations are suggested THEN the system SHALL include benchmarking and validation approaches
5. IF breaking changes are required THEN the system SHALL provide backward compatibility strategies and migration timelines
