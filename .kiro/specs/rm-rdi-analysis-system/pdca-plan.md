**Mission**: Create comprehensive analysis framework for evaluating, monitoring, and optimizing existing RM and RDI systems  
**Timeline**: 10 weeks (2 weeks per phase)  
**Risk Level**: Medium-High (new system integration with existing architecture)

### Model-Driven Intelligence Planning

### Operational Safety Assessment

#### üö® **CRITICAL OPERATOR CONCERNS**
**"If it works, don't break it with cheesy enhancements. Downtime is unpleasant."**

#### ‚úÖ **Zero-Risk Prerequisites**
1. **Existing Systems UNTOUCHED**: No modifications to ReflectiveModule or DocumentManagementRM
2. **Read-Only Operations**: Analysis system only READS existing data, never writes
3. **Separate Process Space**: Analysis runs in isolated environment, cannot crash main systems
4. **Optional Service**: Can be completely disabled without affecting core functionality
5. **No Dependencies**: Core RM/RDI systems work perfectly without analysis system

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Operational Safety Guarantees**
1. **ZERO DOWNTIME RISK**: Analysis system cannot cause production outages
2. **ZERO DATA RISK**: Read-only access, no database writes, no file modifications
3. **ZERO PERFORMANCE IMPACT**: Resource-limited, can be throttled or disabled instantly
4. **ZERO INTEGRATION RISK**: Completely decoupled from production workflows
5. **ZERO DEPLOYMENT RISK**: Can be deployed/removed without touching existing code

#### üîß **Operator-First Design**
1. **Kill Switch**: Single command to disable entire analysis system (`make analysis-disable`)
2. **Resource Limits**: Hard CPU/memory limits, automatic throttling
3. **Monitoring**: Analysis system monitors itself, alerts on any issues
4. **Isolation**: Runs in separate containers/processes, cannot affect main systems
