# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Beast Mode framework currently has 67 failed tests out of 1338 total tests (95% pass rate), revealing systematic patterns that require targeted remediation. This feature will systematically resolve test failures through a requirements-driven implementation (RDI) approach, addressing root causes rather than symptoms. The analysis has identified 10 distinct failure patterns across critical system components including orchestration engines, evidence generation, path handling, and safety systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all core dependencies to be properly available during test execution, so that basic functionality tests can run without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all core dependencies SHALL be available and importable
2. WHEN `test_basic.py::test_core_dependencies_available` runs THEN jinja2 SHALL be importable without ModuleNotFoundError
3. WHEN any test imports core modules THEN no ImportError SHALL occur for required dependencies
4. WHEN the test environment is validated THEN all requirements.txt dependencies SHALL be properly installed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component interfaces to have the expected attributes and methods, so that orchestration and CLI functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DecisionContext objects are used THEN they SHALL have a confidence_score attribute
2. WHEN BeastModeCLI command history is accessed THEN get_command_history method SHALL exist and function
3. WHEN ToolOrchestrator optimization methods are called THEN _improve_tool_compliance and _optimize_tool_performance methods SHALL exist
4. WHEN orchestration engine uses DecisionContext THEN no AttributeError SHALL occur for expected attributes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all class constructors to accept the expected parameters, so that evidence generation and health reporting systems work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evidence package objects are created THEN constructors SHALL accept concrete_proof parameter without TypeError
2. WHEN health alert objects are instantiated THEN metric_value and threshold_value SHALL be required parameters
3. WHEN dataclass objects are initialized THEN all expected keyword arguments SHALL be accepted
4. WHEN evidence generation workflow runs THEN no constructor signature mismatch errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent path handling across all file operations, so that file analysis and dependency detection work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file paths are processed THEN absolute and relative paths SHALL be handled consistently
2. WHEN path operations are performed THEN no ValueError for path mismatches SHALL occur
3. WHEN file analysis runs THEN paths SHALL be normalized to a consistent format
4. WHEN dependency analysis processes files THEN path resolution SHALL succeed without subpath errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test assertions to match actual implementation behavior, so that tests provide accurate validation of system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assertion tests run THEN expected values SHALL match actual implementation values
2. WHEN collection tests run THEN size expectations SHALL be correct for actual data structures
3. WHEN behavior tests run THEN expected outcomes SHALL align with current implementation behavior
4. WHEN mock configurations are used THEN they SHALL reflect real system responses accurately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enum types to be properly serializable and accessible, so that reporting and error handling systems work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN objects containing enums are serialized to JSON THEN IssueSeverity enums SHALL be serializable
2. WHEN enum attributes are accessed THEN no AttributeError SHALL occur for valid enum values
3. WHEN health reports are exported THEN enum serialization SHALL complete successfully
4. WHEN data structures with enums are processed THEN custom JSON encoding SHALL handle enum types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want safety systems to allow legitimate operations while blocking unsafe ones, so that analysis orchestration works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legitimate workflow creation is requested THEN safety system SHALL allow the operation
2. WHEN analysis operations run THEN safety violations SHALL only occur for actual unsafe operations
3. WHEN orchestration workflows execute THEN safety checks SHALL be appropriately configured for test environments
4. WHEN safety system validation occurs THEN it SHALL not block legitimate test operations inappropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want async operations and network calls to complete successfully, so that API integration and testing work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API client operations run THEN async context managers SHALL work correctly without __aenter__ errors
2. WHEN network mocking is used THEN async operations SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN coroutine warnings SHALL not occur
4. WHEN async context management is used THEN proper async/await patterns SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data validation rules to be appropriately configured, so that validation systems are not overly restrictive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ProjectMetadata is validated THEN validation rules SHALL allow legitimate data structures
2. WHEN Pydantic validation occurs THEN it SHALL not reject valid data with overly strict rules
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be for actual data problems, not configuration issues
4. WHEN validation systems run THEN they SHALL provide clear guidance for resolving validation failures

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance expectations to be realistic and timeout handling to work correctly, so that performance validation tests pass consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN expectations SHALL match actual system capabilities
2. WHEN timeout operations are tested THEN timeout handling SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN performance validation occurs THEN metrics SHALL be collected accurately
4. WHEN timing-sensitive tests run THEN they SHALL account for system variability appropriately
