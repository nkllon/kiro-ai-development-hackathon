# Beast Mode Core Requirements

## Introduction

The Beast Mode Core serves as the central coordination and integration hub for all Beast Mode components. This component focuses exclusively on system orchestration, service delivery to external hackathons, and maintaining the overall systematic superiority demonstration. It coordinates between specialized components while providing clean service interfaces for external consumers.

**Single Responsibility:** Coordinate Beast Mode components and provide systematic services to external hackathons while demonstrating measurable superiority.

## Dependency Architecture

**Foundation Dependencies:** This specification depends on multiple specialized Beast Mode components and the Ghostbusters Framework.

**Dependency Relationship:**
```
Ghostbusters Framework (Foundation)
    ↓
[Systematic PDCA Orchestrator, Tool Health Manager, Systematic Metrics Engine, Parallel DAG Orchestrator] (Components)
    ↓
Beast Mode Core (This Spec - Integration Hub)
    ↓
[Git DevOps Pipeline, Devpost Integration, GKE Hackathon] (External Consumers)
```

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Orchestration and Integration

**User Story:** As Beast Mode Core, I want to orchestrate all specialized Beast Mode components, so that I can provide cohesive systematic services while maintaining clear component boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external services are requested THEN I SHALL coordinate appropriate specialized components (PDCA Orchestrator, Tool Health Manager, Metrics Engine, Parallel DAG Orchestrator)
2. WHEN components interact THEN I SHALL maintain clear boundaries and prevent direct component-to-component dependencies
3. WHEN orchestrating workflows THEN I SHALL ensure systematic approach is maintained across all component interactions
4. WHEN component failures occur THEN I SHALL provide graceful degradation and systematic error recovery
5. WHEN new components are added THEN I SHALL integrate them through standardized interfaces without modifying existing components

### Requirement 2: External Service Delivery

**User Story:** As Beast Mode Core, I want to provide systematic services to external hackathons, so that I can demonstrate Beast Mode value through concrete service delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GKE hackathon requests PDCA services THEN I SHALL coordinate with Systematic PDCA Orchestrator to provide working systematic development workflow
2. WHEN external hackathons need tool health management THEN I SHALL coordinate with Tool Health Manager to provide systematic tool fixing capabilities
3. WHEN service delivery occurs THEN I SHALL coordinate with Systematic Metrics Engine to measure improvement over ad-hoc approaches
4. WHEN complex parallel workloads are required THEN I SHALL coordinate with Parallel DAG Orchestrator for scalable execution
5. WHEN services are provided THEN I SHALL demonstrate measurable improvement in external hackathon development velocity

### Requirement 3: Systematic Superiority Demonstration

**User Story:** As Beast Mode Core, I want to demonstrate systematic superiority over regular hackathon approaches, so that I can prove Beast Mode methodology works through concrete, measurable results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating superiority THEN I SHALL coordinate with all components to provide comprehensive evidence of systematic effectiveness
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN I SHALL show concrete metrics proving faster problem resolution, fewer broken tools, and higher success rates
3. WHEN comparing approaches THEN I SHALL provide side-by-side analysis of systematic vs ad-hoc methodologies
4. WHEN evidence is requested THEN I SHALL generate comprehensive reports with statistical validation and confidence scoring
5. WHEN superiority claims are made THEN I SHALL back them with concrete, measurable data from real hackathon scenarios

### Requirement 4: Cross-Spec Integration and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As Beast Mode Core, I want to provide clean integration interfaces for external specs, so that I can prevent circular dependencies and maintain RDI hygiene across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external specs reference Beast Mode capabilities THEN I SHALL provide well-defined service interfaces that prevent circular dependencies
2. WHEN Devpost Integration requires Beast Mode infrastructure THEN I SHALL expose configuration management, logging, and error handling through dedicated service APIs
3. WHEN Git DevOps Pipeline needs systematic approaches THEN I SHALL coordinate appropriate component services without exposing internal implementation details
4. WHEN integration points are defined THEN I SHALL prevent circular dependencies through systematic dependency analysis
5. WHEN dependency conflicts arise THEN I SHALL coordinate with appropriate components to provide systematic RCA analysis and resolution guidance

### Requirement 5: Multi-Perspective Stakeholder Analysis

**User Story:** As Beast Mode Core, I want to coordinate multi-perspective stakeholder analysis for complex decisions, so that I can reduce decision-making risk through systematic analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN decision confidence is below 50% THEN I SHALL coordinate with Ghostbusters Framework to trigger multi-perspective analysis
2. WHEN stakeholder analysis is required THEN I SHALL coordinate systematic evaluation from Beast Mode, GKE Consumer, DevOps, Development, and Evaluator perspectives
3. WHEN perspectives are analyzed THEN I SHALL use Ghostbusters consensus mechanisms to synthesize viewpoints into risk-reduced decisions
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN I SHALL provide comprehensive decision documentation with confidence scoring and risk assessment
5. WHEN complex decisions arise THEN I SHALL coordinate with appropriate specialized components for domain-specific analysis

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### DR1: Integration Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coordinating components THEN service orchestration SHALL complete within 500ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN providing external services THEN response times SHALL be <500ms for 99% of service requests to maintain GKE hackathon productivity
3. WHEN demonstrating superiority THEN evidence generation SHALL complete within 10 seconds for standard reports
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN conflict analysis SHALL complete within 2 seconds for typical dependency graphs
5. WHEN scaling coordination THEN system SHALL handle coordination for 10+ concurrent external hackathon service requests

### DR2: Service Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any specialized component fails THEN system SHALL continue operating with degraded functionality rather than complete failure
2. WHEN external service requests occur THEN system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for critical Beast Mode services
3. WHEN component coordination fails THEN system SHALL provide graceful degradation with clear error reporting
4. WHEN under high load THEN system SHALL maintain service quality through intelligent load balancing across components
5. WHEN integration issues arise THEN system SHALL provide systematic troubleshooting guidance and escalation procedures
