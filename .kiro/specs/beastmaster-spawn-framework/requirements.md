# Requirements Document - Beastmaster Spawn Framework

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for the "Beastmaster Spawn" framework - a systematic approach to creating independent repositories that inherit Beast Mode DNA while operating autonomously. This framework enables the creation of specialized repositories (hackathon projects, proof-of-concepts, client demos, etc.) that carry forward systematic approaches, PDCA methodology, and proven patterns while being completely self-contained.

The Beastmaster Spawn concept enables us to create focused, purpose-optimized repositories that demonstrate systematic superiority while remaining accessible to fresh Kiro instances that know nothing about the parent Beast Mode system. Each spawn is designed to impress stakeholders (judges, clients, teams) with systematic excellence while being completely independent.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Autonomous Spawn Creation

**User Story:** As a Beastmaster, I want to spawn independent repositories that inherit Beast Mode DNA, so that they can operate autonomously while demonstrating systematic superiority.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the spawn creation script THEN the system SHALL create a completely independent repository with Beast Mode DNA
2. WHEN the spawn is created THEN it SHALL be self-contained with no dependencies on the parent Beast Mode system
3. WHEN I work in the spawn THEN it SHALL function as a standalone project that impresses stakeholders
4. WHEN fresh Kiro instances encounter the spawn THEN they SHALL understand it immediately without Beast Mode context
5. WHEN the spawn evolves THEN it SHALL maintain its systematic approach while adapting to specific requirements
6. WHEN stakeholders evaluate the spawn THEN they SHALL see systematic superiority and innovative architecture

### Requirement 2: Spore-Based DNA Transfer

**User Story:** As a Beastmaster creating spawns, I want to package essential Beast Mode DNA into spores that receiving LLMs can consume and assimilate, so that they can grow systematic capabilities from "I know nothing" to full systematic superiority.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a spore THEN it SHALL contain all necessary Beast Mode DNA for the target spawn type
2. WHEN a spore is created THEN it SHALL be self-contained with complete systematic patterns and principles
3. WHEN a receiving LLM consumes the spore THEN it SHALL either implement directly or assimilate systematically
4. WHEN spore assimilation occurs THEN the LLM SHALL grow from "Sergeant Schultz" state to systematic competence
5. WHEN the spore germinates THEN the target repository SHALL have complete `.kiro/` directory structure
6. WHEN spores are customized THEN the system SHALL support different spore types for different spawn purposes

### Requirement 3: Selective Spore Packaging

**User Story:** As a developer creating specialized spores, I want to package only relevant Beast Mode DNA, so that receiving LLMs can assimilate efficiently without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a spawn type THEN the spore packaging system SHALL select appropriate DNA domains
2. WHEN packaging steering rules THEN the system SHALL filter for relevant architectural principles
3. WHEN including specs THEN the spore SHALL contain only foundational patterns and frameworks
4. WHEN packaging deployment knowledge THEN the spore SHALL focus on the target platform or use case
5. WHEN including testing patterns THEN the spore SHALL contain systematic testing approaches
6. WHEN DNA is packaged THEN the spore SHALL maintain coherence and avoid broken references

### Requirement 4: Multi-Tier Spore Consumption

**User Story:** As a receiving LLM with varying capability levels, I want spores designed for my interpretation abilities, so that I can assimilate Beast Mode DNA regardless of my sophistication level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am an advanced LLM THEN I SHALL consume self-executing spores and assimilate DNA autonomously
2. WHEN I am a standard LLM THEN I SHALL follow guided spores with explicit implementation instructions
3. WHEN I am a basic LLM THEN I SHALL execute hand-fed spores with step-by-step guidance
4. WHEN spore consumption occurs THEN I SHALL grow from "I know nothing" to systematic competence at my capability level
5. WHEN spores are multi-tiered THEN they SHALL include fallback formats for different LLM capabilities
6. WHEN assimilation completes THEN I SHALL demonstrate systematic superiority appropriate to my processing abilities

### Requirement 5: Adaptive Spore Format Design

**User Story:** As a Beastmaster creating spores for diverse LLM capabilities, I want spore formats that adapt to different interpretation abilities, so that any LLM can benefit from Beast Mode DNA regardless of sophistication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating spores THEN the system SHALL package DNA in multiple format tiers
2. WHEN advanced interpretation is available THEN spores SHALL provide autonomous assimilation patterns
3. WHEN standard interpretation is detected THEN spores SHALL include explicit implementation guidance
4. WHEN basic interpretation is required THEN spores SHALL provide hand-feeding instructions
5. WHEN LLM capabilities are unknown THEN spores SHALL include capability detection and format selection
6. WHEN spore formats are layered THEN they SHALL maintain DNA coherence across all tiers

### Requirement 6: Automated Repository Bootstrapping

**User Story:** As a developer starting a new spawn project, I want automated bootstrapping that creates a complete project structure, so that I can focus on spawn-specific development immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the bootstrap script THEN it SHALL create a complete project directory structure
2. WHEN bootstrapping occurs THEN the system SHALL initialize git repository with proper `.gitignore`
3. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL include a `.kiro/` directory with seeded knowledge
4. WHEN bootstrapping completes THEN the system SHALL create initial documentation and README files
5. WHEN the project is ready THEN it SHALL include deployment scripts adapted for the target platform
6. WHEN I start development THEN the project SHALL be immediately ready for Kiro IDE integration

### Requirement 5: Spawn Evolution Feedback

**User Story:** As a Beastmaster managing multiple spawns, I want successful patterns from spawns to evolve back into Beast Mode DNA, so that future spawns benefit from proven innovations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spawn projects develop successful patterns THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to extract them
2. WHEN patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL validate their applicability to Beast Mode
3. WHEN patterns are validated THEN the system SHALL provide merge-back capabilities
4. WHEN knowledge flows back THEN it SHALL be integrated into the main Beast Mode registry
5. WHEN patterns are generalized THEN they SHALL become available for future seeding operations
6. WHEN learning occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain traceability of pattern origins

### Requirement 6: Multi-Platform Deployment Seeding

**User Story:** As a developer targeting specific platforms or use cases, I want seeding scripts that include optimized deployment configurations, so that I can deploy effectively on the target platform immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I seed for cloud platforms THEN the system SHALL include platform-optimized deployment configurations
2. WHEN I seed for specific use cases THEN the system SHALL include relevant architectural patterns
3. WHEN I seed for client demos THEN the system SHALL include presentation-ready deployment approaches
4. WHEN deployment configs are seeded THEN they SHALL be immediately executable with minimal configuration
5. WHEN platform-specific features are included THEN they SHALL showcase best practices for that platform
6. WHEN deployment patterns are transferred THEN they SHALL include monitoring and observability configurations

### Requirement 7: Purpose-Optimized Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a spawn developer, I want seeded repositories to include purpose-optimized development workflows, so that I can maximize productivity for the specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repositories are seeded THEN they SHALL include rapid development scripts and templates
2. WHEN development workflows are included THEN they SHALL prioritize the spawn's primary objective
3. WHEN testing frameworks are seeded THEN they SHALL focus on essential validation for the use case
4. WHEN documentation templates are included THEN they SHALL be optimized for the target audience
5. WHEN deployment scripts are seeded THEN they SHALL prioritize quick deployment and easy demonstration
6. WHEN the workflow is complete THEN it SHALL support the full spawn lifecycle from creation to delivery

### Requirement 8: Spawn Type Templates

**User Story:** As a Beastmaster, I want predefined spawn templates for common use cases, so that I can quickly create purpose-built repositories with appropriate DNA.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a hackathon spawn THEN it SHALL include rapid prototyping and demo-optimized patterns
