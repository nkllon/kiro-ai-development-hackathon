# Recovery Engine Framework Requirements

## Introduction

The Recovery Engine Framework provides systematic fix application and recovery pattern management for code issues detected by analysis agents. This service focuses exclusively on applying fixes without analysis, detection, or orchestration concerns, delegating those to appropriate specialized services.

**Single Responsibility:** Systematic fix application and recovery patterns only
**Dependencies:** Code Analysis Agents, Build Test Agents (for issue detection)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Fix Application

**User Story:** As a recovery system, I want systematic fix application capabilities, so that detected code issues can be resolved automatically while maintaining functional equivalence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN issues are detected by analysis agents THEN appropriate recovery engines SHALL be selected automatically
2. WHEN fixes are applied THEN they SHALL maintain functional equivalence and never introduce new issues
3. WHEN recovery completes THEN the system SHALL validate that fixes resolve the original issues
4. WHEN multiple fix options exist THEN the system SHALL select the most appropriate based on context
5. WHEN fixes fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis and escalation guidance

### Requirement 2: Recovery Pattern Management

**User Story:** As a recovery system, I want recovery pattern management, so that successful fix patterns can be learned and reused systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recovery patterns are successful THEN they SHALL be learned and applied to similar future scenarios
2. WHEN new issue types are encountered THEN the system SHALL develop appropriate recovery patterns
3. WHEN patterns prove ineffective THEN they SHALL be refined based on failure analysis
4. WHEN pattern libraries grow THEN they SHALL be organized for efficient pattern matching
5. WHEN patterns are applied THEN they SHALL be validated for continued effectiveness

### Requirement 3: Specialized Recovery Engines

**User Story:** As a recovery system, I want specialized recovery engines, so that different types of code issues can be addressed with domain-specific expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syntax issues are detected THEN SyntaxRecoveryEngine SHALL apply appropriate syntax corrections
2. WHEN indentation problems occur THEN IndentationFixer SHALL resolve formatting issues systematically
3. WHEN import issues are found THEN ImportResolver SHALL fix import and dependency problems
4. WHEN security issues are detected THEN SecurityRemediationEngine SHALL apply security fixes safely
5. WHEN recovery engines operate THEN they SHALL coordinate to avoid conflicting modifications

### Requirement 4: Safe Recovery Operations

**User Story:** As a recovery system, I want safe recovery operations, so that fixes never corrupt code or introduce new problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL create backups before any modifications
2. WHEN recovery operations execute THEN they SHALL validate changes before committing
3. WHEN conflicts arise between fixes THEN the system SHALL resolve them systematically
4. WHEN recovery fails THEN the system SHALL restore original state automatically
5. WHEN fixes are validated THEN they SHALL be tested for functional equivalence

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN recovery SHALL complete within 1 second for common issue patterns
2. WHEN complex recovery is needed THEN operations SHALL complete within 5 seconds for standard scenarios
3. WHEN concurrent recovery occurs THEN the system SHALL handle 20+ simultaneous recovery operations
4. WHEN large files are processed THEN memory usage SHALL remain under 150MB per recovery operation
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN core recovery functionality SHALL remain available

### Derived Requirement 2: Safety Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recovery operations execute THEN they SHALL never corrupt existing code functionality
2. WHEN fixes are applied THEN they SHALL be validated for correctness before commitment
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL restore original state without data loss
4. WHEN multiple engines operate THEN they SHALL coordinate to prevent conflicting changes
5. WHEN recovery completes THEN all changes SHALL be auditable and reversible
