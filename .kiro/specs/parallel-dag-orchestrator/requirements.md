# Parallel DAG Orchestrator Requirements

## Introduction

The Parallel DAG Orchestrator provides scalable parallel execution management for independent tasks through DAG analysis and agent orchestration. This component focuses exclusively on creating parallel execution opportunities, launching independent agents with branch parameters, and managing both local and cloud-based scaling. It maintains systematic quality across parallel workloads while providing transparent execution abstraction.

**Single Responsibility:** Orchestrate parallel execution of independent tasks through DAG management and scalable agent coordination.

## Dependency Architecture

**Foundation Dependency:** This specification depends on the Ghostbusters Framework for multi-agent orchestration and expert agents.

**Dependency Relationship:**

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Dependency Analysis and DAG Creation

**User Story:** As a parallel DAG orchestrator, I want to analyze task dependencies and create parallel execution DAGs, so that I can identify opportunities for independent parallel execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN task dependencies are analyzed THEN I SHALL create or update parallel execution DAGs when tasks can be flattened for independent execution
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN I SHALL identify task groups that can execute in parallel without conflicts
3. WHEN creating DAGs THEN I SHALL optimize for maximum parallelization while maintaining systematic constraints
4. WHEN DAG structure changes THEN I SHALL update execution plans dynamically based on new dependency information
5. WHEN DAGs are created THEN I SHALL validate that parallel execution maintains systematic quality and constraint satisfaction

### Requirement 2: Agent Orchestration and Branch Management

**User Story:** As a parallel DAG orchestrator, I want to launch independent agents with branch parameters, so that I can execute parallel tasks in isolation while maintaining coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parallel tasks are identified THEN I SHALL launch independent agents (Kiro command line, API, or other facilities) with branch parameters specifying the target branch for each task
2. WHEN agents are launched THEN I SHALL ensure complete isolation between parallel executions to prevent cross-contamination
3. WHEN branch parameters are specified THEN I SHALL maintain systematic constraints and quality requirements across all parallel agents
4. WHEN agents execute THEN I SHALL provide coordination mechanisms that enable result aggregation without breaking isolation
5. WHEN parallel execution completes THEN I SHALL merge results systematically and validate overall task completion through RCA analysis

### Requirement 3: Execution Strategy and Scaling Abstraction

**User Story:** As a parallel DAG orchestrator, I want to provide implementation abstraction for local and cloud execution, so that I can scale transparently based on workload requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are launched THEN I SHALL provide implementation abstraction supporting both local execution and GKE Cloud Functions scaling
2. WHEN using GKE Cloud Functions THEN I SHALL provide scalable agent orchestration that maintains systematic approach and constraint satisfaction
3. WHEN scaling decisions are required THEN I SHALL automatically determine optimal execution strategy (local vs cloud) based on task complexity and resource availability
4. WHEN execution environments change THEN I SHALL maintain identical systematic behavior and quality across local and cloud execution
5. WHEN resource constraints are encountered THEN I SHALL adapt execution strategy dynamically while preserving systematic quality

### Requirement 4: Result Aggregation and Validation

**User Story:** As a parallel DAG orchestrator, I want to systematically aggregate and validate parallel execution results, so that I can ensure overall task completion meets systematic quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parallel execution completes THEN I SHALL collect results from all agents and perform systematic aggregation
2. WHEN aggregating results THEN I SHALL validate that combined outcomes meet original task requirements and systematic constraints
3. WHEN validation occurs THEN I SHALL use Ghostbusters validation framework for comprehensive quality assessment
4. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN I SHALL perform systematic RCA to identify and resolve result inconsistencies
5. WHEN aggregation is complete THEN I SHALL provide comprehensive execution reports with confidence scoring and quality metrics

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### DR1: Parallel Execution Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing task dependencies THEN DAG creation SHALL complete within 1 second for task graphs up to 1000 nodes
2. WHEN launching parallel agents THEN system SHALL support up to 100 concurrent agent executions without performance degradation
3. WHEN using local execution THEN agents SHALL launch within 2 seconds and maintain <500ms inter-agent communication
4. WHEN using GKE Cloud Functions THEN agents SHALL scale automatically based on task queue depth with <10 second cold start times
5. WHEN merging parallel results THEN systematic validation SHALL complete within 5 seconds for results from up to 50 parallel agents

### DR2: Scaling and Resource Management Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between local and cloud execution THEN the abstraction layer SHALL maintain identical systematic behavior and constraint satisfaction
2. WHEN resource utilization is high THEN system SHALL automatically scale to cloud execution without manual intervention
3. WHEN cloud resources are expensive THEN system SHALL optimize for cost-effective execution while maintaining quality
4. WHEN execution fails THEN system SHALL provide graceful degradation and systematic error recovery
5. WHEN branch isolation is required THEN parallel agents SHALL operate independently with zero cross-contamination while enabling result aggregation
