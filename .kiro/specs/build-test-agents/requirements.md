# Build and Test Agents Requirements

## Introduction

The Build and Test Agents provide specialized expert analysis for build systems, testing frameworks, and DevOps workflows. This service focuses exclusively on build and test analysis without orchestration, recovery, or consensus concerns, delegating those to appropriate specialized services.

**Single Responsibility:** Build and test domain analysis only
**Dependencies:** Multi-Agent Consensus Engine (for conflict resolution)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Build Analysis Agent

**User Story:** As a build analysis system, I want specialized build system analysis, so that build issues and configuration problems can be detected systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build configurations are analyzed THEN BuildExpert SHALL detect build system issues and anti-patterns
2. WHEN build problems are found THEN the agent SHALL provide specific configuration remediation guidance
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN BuildExpert SHALL provide build system health metrics
4. WHEN build conflicts arise THEN the agent SHALL use Multi-Agent Consensus Engine for resolution
5. WHEN build technologies evolve THEN the agent SHALL update analysis capabilities accordingly

### Requirement 2: Test Analysis Agent

**User Story:** As a test analysis system, I want specialized test framework analysis, so that test quality and coverage issues can be detected systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test code is analyzed THEN TestExpert SHALL detect test quality issues and anti-patterns
2. WHEN test problems are found THEN the agent SHALL provide specific test improvement recommendations
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN TestExpert SHALL provide comprehensive test quality metrics
4. WHEN test strategy conflicts occur THEN the agent SHALL leverage Multi-Agent Consensus Engine
5. WHEN testing frameworks change THEN the agent SHALL adapt analysis criteria appropriately

### Requirement 3: DevOps Analysis Agent

**User Story:** As a DevOps analysis system, I want specialized DevOps workflow analysis, so that deployment and infrastructure issues can be detected systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DevOps configurations are analyzed THEN DevOpsExpert SHALL detect workflow issues and anti-patterns
2. WHEN DevOps problems are found THEN the agent SHALL provide specific workflow improvement guidance
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN DevOpsExpert SHALL validate DevOps best practices compliance
4. WHEN DevOps conflicts arise THEN the agent SHALL use Multi-Agent Consensus Engine for resolution
5. WHEN DevOps technologies evolve THEN the agent SHALL update validation capabilities

### Requirement 4: Integration Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As a build and test system, I want integration analysis capabilities, so that cross-domain issues between build, test, and DevOps can be detected systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-domain analysis is needed THEN agents SHALL coordinate through Multi-Agent Consensus Engine
2. WHEN integration issues are detected THEN agents SHALL provide holistic remediation strategies
3. WHEN analysis spans multiple domains THEN agents SHALL maintain consistency in recommendations
4. WHEN integration patterns succeed THEN they SHALL be learned for future cross-domain scenarios
5. WHEN integration conflicts occur THEN they SHALL be resolved through systematic consensus mechanisms

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build configurations are analyzed THEN analysis SHALL complete within 3 seconds for standard projects
2. WHEN test suites are analyzed THEN analysis SHALL complete within 5 seconds for up to 1000 tests
3. WHEN DevOps workflows are analyzed THEN analysis SHALL complete within 2 seconds for typical configurations
4. WHEN concurrent analysis occurs THEN agents SHALL handle 30+ simultaneous analysis requests
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN agents SHALL maintain core analysis functionality with graceful degradation
