# GitKraken API Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines an optional GitKraken API integration to enhance git operations in the Beast Mode Framework. The integration provides a premium git experience for users with GitKraken licenses while maintaining full functionality for open source developers using standard git. This follows the principle of progressive enhancement - core functionality works for everyone, premium features enhance the experience for licensed users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Optional GitKraken API Client

**User Story:** As a developer with a GitKraken license, I want to optionally use GitKraken's API for enhanced git operations, while ensuring the system works perfectly for developers without licenses using standard git.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitKraken license is detected THEN the system SHALL offer GitKraken API as an enhanced option
2. WHEN no GitKraken license is available THEN the system SHALL use standard git operations seamlessly
3. WHEN GitKraken API is enabled THEN it SHALL provide enhanced visualization and conflict resolution
4. WHEN GitKraken API fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to standard git without user intervention
5. WHEN configuring git operations THEN users SHALL be able to enable/disable GitKraken integration via configuration

### Requirement 2: Branch Management Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage branches through GitKraken API so that I can visualize branch relationships and perform merges more safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing branches THEN the system SHALL retrieve branch information including ahead/behind status
2. WHEN creating branches THEN the system SHALL use GitKraken API to create and track branches
3. WHEN merging branches THEN the system SHALL use GitKraken's merge conflict resolution capabilities
4. WHEN switching branches THEN the system SHALL update the working directory through the API

### Requirement 3: Commit and Push Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to commit and push changes through GitKraken API so that I can leverage GitKraken's commit message templates and push validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staging files THEN the system SHALL use GitKraken API to stage changes selectively
2. WHEN creating commits THEN the system SHALL use GitKraken's commit message validation
3. WHEN pushing changes THEN the system SHALL use GitKraken API with progress tracking
4. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL use GitKraken's conflict resolution interface

### Requirement 4: Repository Status and History

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query repository status through GitKraken API so that I can get rich git information without parsing command-line output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking repository status THEN the system SHALL return structured data about changes
2. WHEN viewing commit history THEN the system SHALL provide detailed commit information with metadata
3. WHEN analyzing branch relationships THEN the system SHALL provide visual branch graph data
4. WHEN detecting conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide detailed conflict information

### Requirement 5: Integration with Beast Mode Framework

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Framework user, I want GitKraken integration to enhance but never block my systematic development process, ensuring full functionality regardless of license status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Beast Mode performs git operations THEN it SHALL use the best available git method (GitKraken API if licensed, standard git otherwise)
2. WHEN GitKraken integration is disabled THEN all Beast Mode functionality SHALL work identically using standard git
3. WHEN performing PDCA cycles THEN git operations SHALL be tracked regardless of the underlying git method
4. WHEN systematic tool repair is needed THEN both GitKraken API and standard git health SHALL be monitored
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL work immediately without requiring any premium licenses

### Requirement 6: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want GitKraken API integration to handle credentials securely so that my license and repository access are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing GitKraken credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure credential storage
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication headers
3. WHEN credentials expire THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully
4. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff strategies

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitKraken API integration to be resilient so that git operations don't fail due to API issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitKraken API is down THEN the system SHALL fallback to command-line git automatically
2. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry
4. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL log errors and use fallback methods
#
## Requirement 8: Open Source Compatibility

**User Story:** As an open source developer, I want the Beast Mode Framework to provide full functionality without requiring any premium licenses so that I can contribute and use the system freely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no GitKraken license is present THEN all core functionality SHALL work using standard git
2. WHEN contributing to the project THEN developers SHALL NOT be required to purchase licenses
3. WHEN documenting the system THEN GitKraken integration SHALL be clearly marked as optional premium enhancement
4. WHEN testing the system THEN all tests SHALL pass using standard git without GitKraken
5. WHEN deploying in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL work in environments without GitKraken licenses

### Requirement 9: Progressive Enhancement Model

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want GitKraken integration to follow progressive enhancement principles so that premium features enhance but never replace core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing git operations THEN standard git SHALL be the baseline implementation
2. WHEN GitKraken features are available THEN they SHALL enhance the user experience without changing core behavior
3. WHEN switching between git methods THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN new git features are added THEN they SHALL work with both standard git and GitKraken API
5. WHEN documenting features THEN the baseline (standard git) functionality SHALL be documented first
