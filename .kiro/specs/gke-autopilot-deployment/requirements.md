# Requirements Document - Universal GKE Autopilot Deployment Framework

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a universal deployment framework for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot, Google's newest serverless Kubernetes offering. This framework should work for any containerized application, providing a systematic approach to GKE Autopilot deployment that eliminates node management overhead while providing full Kubernetes API compatibility.

GKE Autopilot represents the evolution of Kubernetes toward serverless, where Google manages the entire infrastructure while developers focus purely on application deployment. This framework will provide a reusable, systematic approach that any development team can use to deploy their applications on GKE Autopilot with minimal configuration and maximum benefit.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Universal Application Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer with any containerized application, I want to deploy it on GKE Autopilot using a systematic framework, so that I can leverage Kubernetes features without managing nodes or infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the GKE Autopilot deployment script THEN the system SHALL create an Autopilot cluster automatically
2. WHEN the cluster is created THEN the system SHALL deploy any containerized application without requiring node configuration
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide a public HTTPS endpoint for the application
4. WHEN I access the application THEN it SHALL respond with full functionality
5. IF the cluster doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with Autopilot mode enabled
6. WHEN the application scales THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL automatically provision compute resources as needed

### Requirement 2: Cost-Optimized Resource Management

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious developer, I want GKE Autopilot to automatically optimize resource usage, so that I only pay for what the application actually uses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is idle THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL scale pods to minimum required replicas
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL automatically scale pods and provision compute resources
3. WHEN I deploy the service THEN the system SHALL use resource requests that align with Autopilot's optimization
4. WHEN pods are scheduled THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL automatically select the most cost-effective compute resources
5. WHEN the service is not in use THEN the system SHALL minimize costs through automatic resource optimization
6. WHEN I query costs THEN the system SHALL provide clear visibility into Autopilot resource consumption

### Requirement 3: Zero Infrastructure Management

**User Story:** As a developer focused on application logic, I want GKE Autopilot to handle all infrastructure concerns, so that I can focus entirely on my application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy to GKE Autopilot THEN the system SHALL require no node pool configuration
2. WHEN the cluster operates THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL automatically handle node provisioning, patching, and upgrades
3. WHEN security updates are available THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL automatically apply them without downtime
4. WHEN the workload changes THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL automatically adjust the underlying infrastructure
5. WHEN I need to troubleshoot THEN the system SHALL provide application-level logs without requiring node access
6. WHEN compliance is required THEN GKE Autopilot SHALL automatically maintain security and compliance standards

### Requirement 4: Kubernetes-Native Features

**User Story:** As a developer building cloud-native applications, I want full access to Kubernetes features, so that I can use standard Kubernetes patterns and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I deploy the application THEN it SHALL use standard Kubernetes Deployment, Service, and Ingress resources
2. WHEN I need configuration THEN the system SHALL support ConfigMaps and Secrets
3. WHEN I need persistence THEN the system SHALL support Persistent Volumes with automatic provisioning
4. WHEN I need networking THEN the system SHALL support standard Kubernetes networking and service discovery
5. WHEN I use kubectl THEN all standard Kubernetes commands SHALL work normally
6. WHEN I need monitoring THEN the system SHALL integrate with Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging

### Requirement 5: Hackathon-Optimized Experience

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want the GKE Autopilot deployment to be fast and impressive, so that I can quickly demonstrate my application capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the deployment command THEN the system SHALL complete deployment in under 10 minutes
2. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide a ready-to-demo HTTPS URL
3. WHEN I demonstrate the system THEN it SHALL showcase both my application and Google Cloud's latest Kubernetes technology
4. WHEN judges evaluate the project THEN the deployment SHALL highlight innovative use of GKE Autopilot
5. WHEN I present the architecture THEN the system SHALL demonstrate serverless Kubernetes best practices
6. WHEN I explain the benefits THEN the system SHALL clearly show advantages over traditional Kubernetes

### Requirement 6: Production-Ready Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer planning for production, I want the GKE Autopilot deployment to include production-ready features, so that the same deployment can scale from demo to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL include health checks and readiness probes
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale using Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
3. WHEN the service needs updates THEN the system SHALL support rolling deployments with zero downtime
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and monitoring
5. WHEN security is required THEN the system SHALL use Google-managed SSL certificates
6. WHEN high availability is needed THEN the system SHALL deploy across multiple zones automatically

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Deployment Options

**User Story:** As a developer with multiple deployment targets, I want GKE Autopilot to integrate seamlessly with existing deployment options, so that I can choose the best option for each use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the same container image THEN it SHALL work identically across Cloud Run, GKE Standard, and GKE Autopilot
2. WHEN I switch between deployment options THEN the application behavior SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN I compare options THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on when to use GKE Autopilot
4. WHEN I migrate between options THEN the system SHALL support seamless migration paths
5. WHEN I use the same configuration THEN environment variables and secrets SHALL work consistently
6. WHEN I monitor the service THEN metrics and logging SHALL be consistent across deployment options

### Requirement 8: Framework Configurability

**User Story:** As a developer with different application types, I want the framework to be easily configurable for my specific needs, so that I can deploy any containerized application with minimal setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have a containerized application THEN the framework SHALL accept basic configuration (image, port, environment variables)
2. WHEN I need custom resources THEN the framework SHALL support CPU and memory specifications
3. WHEN I have application-specific needs THEN the framework SHALL support custom environment variables and secrets
4. WHEN I need persistence THEN the framework SHALL support optional persistent volume configuration
5. WHEN I have multiple environments THEN the framework SHALL support environment-specific configurations
6. WHEN I need custom domains THEN the framework SHALL support custom domain configuration

### Requirement 9: Developer Experience Excellence

**User Story:** As a developer new to GKE Autopilot, I want excellent documentation and tooling, so that I can quickly understand and use this deployment option effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the documentation THEN it SHALL clearly explain GKE Autopilot benefits and use cases
2. WHEN I run deployment commands THEN they SHALL provide clear progress feedback and status updates
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN I need to debug THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to logs and metrics
5. WHEN I want to customize THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration options
6. WHEN I compare with other options THEN the documentation SHALL provide a clear decision matrix
