# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OpenFlow Backlog Management System is a strategic implementation tracking and prioritization system designed to manage the four key development tracks identified in the OpenFlow-Playground strategic analysis: PR Gate Demo, Zero-Friction Install, Community Mode, and Proof Engine. This system will provide structured requirements management, task prioritization, progress tracking, and delivery coordination across multiple concurrent development streams while maintaining alignment with the overall vision of democratizing software quality automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a centralized backlog management system with explicit dependency tracking, so that I can understand and manage interdependencies between all strategic tracks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create separate backlog domains for each strategic track with explicit dependency declaration capabilities
2. WHEN a backlog item is created THEN it SHALL require explicit declaration of dependencies on other backlog items, including cross-track dependencies
3. WHEN viewing any backlog item THEN the system SHALL display its complete dependency graph including upstream and downstream dependencies
4. WHEN a dependency relationship changes THEN the system SHALL automatically propagate impact analysis to all affected backlog items
5. IF circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and suggest resolution strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want dependency-aware task management, so that I can work on tasks in the correct order and understand blocking relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a task to work on THEN the system SHALL only show tasks whose dependencies are satisfied or provide clear dependency status
2. WHEN a task has cross-track dependencies THEN the system SHALL display the specific blocking items and their estimated completion
3. WHEN completing a task THEN the system SHALL automatically unblock dependent tasks and notify affected team members
4. WHEN a dependency is delayed THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust downstream task estimates and notify stakeholders
5. IF attempting to start a task with unsatisfied dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent start and explain the blocking conditions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want dependency-aware progress visibility, so that I can understand true delivery risks and make informed resource allocation decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting progress reports THEN the system SHALL show critical path analysis across all tracks with dependency bottlenecks highlighted
2. WHEN a dependency changes status THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate impact on all downstream deliverables and update timelines
3. WHEN estimating delivery timelines THEN the system SHALL account for dependency chains and provide best/worst case scenarios based on dependency risk
4. WHEN a critical path item is at risk THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate with specific mitigation options (parallel work, dependency elimination, resource reallocation)
5. IF dependency conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution workflows with stakeholder notification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance lead, I want integrated testing and validation workflows, so that deliverables from each track meet the established quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a track deliverable is marked complete THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate validation workflows (security scans, performance tests, integration tests)
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL create remediation tasks and update track status accordingly
3. WHEN all validation passes THEN the system SHALL automatically promote deliverables to the next stage (staging, production, community release)
4. IF quality metrics fall below thresholds THEN the system SHALL pause track progression and require quality improvement tasks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Marketing Product Manager (MPM), I want to own backlog quality and beast-readiness, so that I can ensure any independent beast can execute items without confusion while maintaining strategic control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating backlog items THEN the system SHALL enforce MPM responsibility for ensuring complete requirements, dependencies, and acceptance criteria before marking items "beast-ready"
2. WHEN reviewing portfolio status THEN the system SHALL provide executive dashboard showing beast-readiness metrics, delivery confidence, and strategic alignment
3. WHEN stakeholders request updates THEN the system SHALL generate business-appropriate reports with delivery projections based on beast-ready item velocity
4. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL allow MPM to rapidly reprioritize with automatic impact analysis and beast-readiness validation
5. WHEN resource constraints arise THEN the system SHALL provide scenario planning tools that account for beast-readiness preparation time
6. IF backlog items lack beast-readiness THEN the system SHALL prevent release to execution pool and notify MPM of required completions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a community contributor, I want clear entry points and contribution workflows, so that I can effectively contribute to any strategic track.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new contributor joins THEN the system SHALL provide track-specific onboarding materials and "good first issues"
2. WHEN contributing to a track THEN the system SHALL validate contributions against track-specific requirements and coding standards
3. WHEN a contribution is accepted THEN the system SHALL update track progress and contributor recognition metrics
4. IF a contribution conflicts with track goals THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and alternative contribution suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an independent beast (developer/agent), I want fully baked backlog items, so that I can pick up any item and execute it without confusion, missing context, or dependency surprises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backlog item is marked "ready for pickup" THEN it SHALL have complete requirements, clear acceptance criteria, and all dependencies satisfied or explicitly documented
2. WHEN an independent beast selects a backlog item THEN they SHALL have access to all necessary context, specifications, and supporting materials without needing to hunt for information
3. WHEN dependencies are listed THEN they SHALL be concrete, actionable, and verifiable - not vague references or assumptions
4. WHEN acceptance criteria are defined THEN they SHALL be testable, measurable, and unambiguous - enabling any beast to know when the work is complete
5. IF a backlog item lacks any required information THEN the system SHALL prevent it from being marked "ready" and highlight what's missing
6. WHEN a beast completes a backlog item THEN the deliverable SHALL meet all specified criteria without requiring interpretation or guesswork

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated dependency validation and backlog health monitoring, so that dependency relationships remain accurate and the backlog stays actionable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency relationships are modified THEN the system SHALL validate the entire dependency graph for consistency and cycles
2. WHEN external dependencies change THEN the system SHALL automatically detect changes and update affected backlog items
3. WHEN dependency chains become too complex THEN the system SHALL suggest simplification strategies and highlight potential risks
4. WHEN orphaned backlog items are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for review and suggest integration points
5. IF dependency data becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL prevent further operations until consistency is restored

## Derived Requirements

### DR-1: RM Compliance Requirement

**Derived From:** System constraint C-01 (RM interface compliance) and architectural requirement for all modules to be RM-compliant

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the backlog management system to be RM-compliant, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing Beast Mode framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backlog management system is implemented THEN it SHALL inherit from ReflectiveModule base class
2. WHEN system health is queried THEN the backlog system SHALL provide comprehensive health status via get_module_status()
3. WHEN system degradation occurs THEN the backlog system SHALL degrade gracefully without killing dependent systems
4. WHEN operational visibility is required THEN the system SHALL provide accurate status reporting for external GKE queries (R6.4)
5. IF the system becomes unhealthy THEN it SHALL report health status accurately via is_healthy() method (R6.2)

### DR-2: Performance Constraint Requirement

**Derived From:** System constraint C-05 (<500ms response) and C-08 (5-minute constraint)

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast backlog operations, so that backlog management doesn't become a bottleneck in development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying backlog status THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for standard operations (C-05)
2. WHEN performing complex dependency analysis THEN the system SHALL complete within 5 minutes (C-08)
3. WHEN multiple users access the backlog concurrently THEN response times SHALL remain within performance constraints
4. WHEN backlog size grows THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through efficient indexing and caching
5. IF performance degrades below thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize or degrade gracefully

### DR-3: File Size and Modularity Requirement

**Derived From:** System constraint of 200-line file limit and single responsibility principle

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want modular backlog components, so that the system remains maintainable and follows established architectural patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing backlog components THEN each file SHALL not exceed 200 lines
2. WHEN designing backlog modules THEN each SHALL have one clear responsibility (single responsibility principle)
3. WHEN components interact THEN they SHALL be interface-constrained to maintain boundaries
4. WHEN adding new functionality THEN it SHALL be implemented as separate modules rather than expanding existing ones
5. IF a component grows beyond size limits THEN it SHALL be automatically flagged for refactoring

### DR-4: Multi-Stakeholder Validation Requirement

**Derived From:** System constraint C-7 (Multi-Stakeholder Perspective Validation) for low-confidence decisions

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want multi-stakeholder validation for complex backlog decisions, so that low-confidence prioritization and dependency decisions get proper review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backlog prioritization confidence is low THEN the system SHALL trigger multi-stakeholder validation (C-7)
2. WHEN dependency conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL engage relevant stakeholders for resolution
3. WHEN strategic track conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL facilitate multi-perspective decision making
4. WHEN resource allocation decisions have high impact THEN the system SHALL require stakeholder consensus
5. IF automated decision confidence falls below threshold THEN the system SHALL escalate to human stakeholders

### DR-5: Ghostbusters Integration Requirement

**Derived From:** Existing Ghostbusters multi-perspective validation system and the reality that requirements always have gaps

**User Story:** As a quality assurance lead, I want Ghostbusters to validate backlog completeness and catch missing perspectives, so that we don't ship incomplete or poorly thought-out backlog items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backlog item is marked "beast-ready" THEN Ghostbusters SHALL validate completeness from multiple perspectives (developer, ops, security, business)
2. WHEN MPM declares an item complete THEN Ghostbusters SHALL check for missing dependencies, edge cases, and perspective gaps
3. WHEN cross-track dependencies are established THEN Ghostbusters SHALL validate impact analysis completeness and stakeholder notification
4. WHEN strategic priorities change THEN Ghostbusters SHALL validate that all affected items have been properly updated and stakeholders notified
5. WHEN beast-readiness criteria are met THEN Ghostbusters SHALL perform final validation that any independent beast can truly execute without confusion
6. IF Ghostbusters find gaps or missing perspectives THEN the system SHALL prevent item release and provide specific remediation guidance
