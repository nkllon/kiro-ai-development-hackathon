# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kiro Hot-Swap Architecture enables seamless platform switching between GKE and Cloud Run without downtime, providing cost optimization and risk mitigation capabilities. This feature allows Kiro agents to maintain a single interface while supporting multiple deployment platforms, with the ability to switch between them based on environment needs, budget constraints, or performance requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy Kiro agents with a platform-agnostic interface, so that I can switch between GKE and Cloud Run without changing the agent code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Kiro agent is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide a unified interface that abstracts platform-specific implementations
2. WHEN switching between platforms THEN the agent SHALL maintain identical request/response behavior
3. WHEN deploying to any supported platform THEN the agent SHALL implement the same core interface methods (process_request, health_check, get_metrics, get_platform_info)
4. IF a platform-specific feature is requested THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without breaking the interface contract

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious developer, I want to automatically switch between Cloud Run for development ($5/month) and GKE for production ($25/month), so that I can optimize costs based on environment needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to development environment THEN the system SHALL default to Cloud Run platform
2. WHEN deploying to production environment THEN the system SHALL default to GKE platform
3. WHEN monthly costs exceed budget threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic platform switching
4. WHEN platform switching occurs THEN the system SHALL log cost savings and platform change reasons
5. IF budget constraints change THEN the system SHALL recalculate optimal platform selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to perform hot-swaps between platforms with zero downtime, so that I can maintain service availability during platform transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a hot-swap THEN the system SHALL deploy the new platform before decommissioning the old one
2. WHEN switching traffic routing THEN the system SHALL ensure zero service interruption
3. WHEN hot-swap completes THEN the system SHALL verify that no requests were dropped during the transition
4. IF new platform health check fails THEN the system SHALL abort the hot-swap and maintain current platform
5. WHEN hot-swap succeeds THEN the system SHALL update monitoring configuration to track the new platform

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want to enforce stateless constraints on GKE deployments, so that hot-swapping remains possible without state migration complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to GKE THEN the system SHALL prohibit PersistentVolumeClaims, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets
2. WHEN validating GKE deployment THEN the system SHALL check for forbidden stateful resources
3. WHEN stateful resources are detected THEN the system SHALL reject the deployment with clear error messages
4. IF deployment passes stateless validation THEN the system SHALL allow GKE deployment to proceed
5. WHEN Cloud Run deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically pass stateless validation (inherently stateless)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want to collect unified metrics across all platforms, so that I can track performance and costs regardless of the current deployment platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent is running THEN the system SHALL collect platform-agnostic metrics (request_count, error_count, avg_response_time, memory_usage, cpu_usage)
2. WHEN hot-swap occurs THEN the system SHALL track swap-specific metrics (swap_duration, downtime, traffic_switch_time, success status)
3. WHEN querying metrics THEN the system SHALL include platform identification in all metric responses
4. IF metrics collection fails THEN the system SHALL log errors without affecting agent functionality
5. WHEN platform changes THEN the system SHALL maintain metric continuity with platform transition markers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manually trigger platform switches for testing or emergency scenarios, so that I can validate hot-swap functionality and respond to platform-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN manual platform switch is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the target platform availability
2. WHEN manual switch is initiated THEN the system SHALL follow the same zero-downtime process as automatic switches
3. WHEN manual switch completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed status report including timing and success metrics
4. IF manual switch fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to the original platform and provide error details
5. WHEN emergency switch is needed THEN the system SHALL prioritize speed while maintaining safety checks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the system to validate platform implementations against the interface contract, so that I can ensure consistent behavior across all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new platform implementation is added THEN the system SHALL validate it implements all required interface methods
2. WHEN platform validation runs THEN the system SHALL test request/response consistency across platforms
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide specific failure reasons
4. IF platform-specific optimizations are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they don't break interface compatibility
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL certify the platform implementation for production use

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive health checks for each platform implementation, so that I can ensure platform readiness before traffic routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN platform deployment completes THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive health checks
2. WHEN health check runs THEN the system SHALL verify all critical endpoints respond correctly
3. WHEN health check fails THEN the system SHALL prevent traffic routing to the unhealthy platform
4. IF health check passes THEN the system SHALL mark the platform as ready for traffic
5. WHEN ongoing health monitoring detects issues THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic failover if alternative platform is available
