# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard for hackathon project management, integrating cost tracking, completion status, token usage monitoring, and anomaly detection across multiple concurrent hackathons. The dashboard provides systematic visibility into project health, budget consumption, and progress metrics to prevent cost overruns and ensure successful project completion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Hackathon Project Overview

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to monitor multiple hackathons simultaneously on separate dashboard tabs, so that I can track progress and resource consumption across all active projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a tab-based interface with one tab per active hackathon
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL load hackathon-specific metrics within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a new hackathon is created THEN the system SHALL automatically create a new monitoring tab
4. IF a hackathon is completed THEN the system SHALL archive the tab while maintaining historical data access
5. WHEN viewing any tab THEN the system SHALL display hackathon name, start date, deadline, and current status

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Cost Monitoring

**User Story:** As a budget owner, I want real-time visibility into token usage costs and GCP billing, so that I can prevent budget overruns and take immediate action when costs spike.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token usage occurs THEN the system SHALL update cost metrics within 30 seconds
2. WHEN costs exceed 80% of budget THEN the system SHALL trigger a warning alert
3. WHEN costs exceed 95% of budget THEN the system SHALL trigger a critical alert
4. IF cost rate increases by 200% over 5-minute average THEN the system SHALL trigger an anomaly alert
5. WHEN viewing cost metrics THEN the system SHALL display current spend, budget remaining, burn rate, and projected completion cost
6. WHEN cost anomalies occur THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, cause analysis, and recommended actions

### Requirement 3: Task Completion Tracking

**User Story:** As a development lead, I want to track completion status against tasks for each hackathon, so that I can calculate accurate percent complete and identify completion gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate completion percentage within 60 seconds
2. WHEN viewing completion status THEN the system SHALL display tasks completed, tasks remaining, blocked tasks, and overall progress percentage
3. WHEN tasks are blocked THEN the system SHALL highlight blockers and estimated impact on completion
4. IF completion rate falls below projected timeline THEN the system SHALL alert with gap analysis
5. WHEN calculating percent complete THEN the system SHALL weight tasks by estimated effort and complexity
6. WHEN gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL provide recommended actions to close gaps

### Requirement 4: Token Usage Analytics

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want detailed token usage analytics with rate monitoring, so that I can optimize AI usage patterns and detect unusual consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are consumed THEN the system SHALL track usage by model, operation type, and time
2. WHEN viewing token analytics THEN the system SHALL display current rate, historical trends, and efficiency metrics
3. WHEN token usage spikes occur THEN the system SHALL identify the source operation and user
4. IF token rate exceeds normal patterns by 300% THEN the system SHALL trigger flood protection alerts
5. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL provide cost per operation and efficiency recommendations
6. WHEN flood conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL implement automatic rate limiting

### Requirement 5: Event-Based Anomaly Detection

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want event-based anomaly detection for cost and usage patterns, so that I can respond immediately to unusual system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger real-time notifications within 15 seconds
2. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL use statistical models to identify deviations from normal behavior
3. WHEN anomalies occur THEN the system SHALL classify severity as INFO, WARNING, or CRITICAL
4. IF multiple anomalies occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL correlate events and identify root causes
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL include anomaly type, severity, affected resources, and recommended actions
6. WHEN anomalies are resolved THEN the system SHALL log resolution time and actions taken

### Requirement 6: Historical Data and Reporting

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want access to historical data and trend analysis, so that I can understand project patterns and improve future hackathon planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide data retention for at least 90 days
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export data in CSV, JSON, and PDF formats
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in cost, completion, and resource usage
4. IF requesting historical analysis THEN the system SHALL provide comparative metrics across hackathons
5. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL highlight successful patterns and areas for improvement
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include metadata, timestamps, and data lineage information

### Requirement 7: Event/Polling Hysteresis Service Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to use the Event/Polling Hysteresis Service for reliable data flow, so that I get event-driven updates with automatic fallback and self-healing without implementing these patterns myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the dashboard THEN the system SHALL require the Event/Polling Hysteresis Service to be available
2. WHEN configuring data sources THEN the system SHALL register cost, task, and token data streams with the hysteresis service
3. WHEN receiving data updates THEN the system SHALL process events from the hysteresis service callbacks
4. IF the hysteresis service fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and degraded functionality
5. WHEN hysteresis service recovers THEN the system SHALL automatically resume full functionality
6. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL include hysteresis service status in overall system health

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to integrate with existing GCP billing, task management, and monitoring systems through the hysteresis service, so that I have a unified view without duplicate data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with GCP THEN the system SHALL configure the hysteresis service to use existing billing APIs
2. WHEN connecting to task systems THEN the system SHALL configure the hysteresis service to sync with current task management tools
3. WHEN accessing monitoring data THEN the system SHALL configure the hysteresis service to integrate with existing Beast Mode metrics
4. IF integration fails THEN the hysteresis service SHALL provide fallback data sources and error notifications
5. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the hysteresis service SHALL implement conflict resolution with audit trails
6. WHEN systems are updated THEN the hysteresis service SHALL maintain integration compatibility

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the dashboard to perform well under high load and scale with multiple concurrent hackathons, so that monitoring remains effective during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN under normal load THEN the system SHALL respond to queries within 2 seconds
2. WHEN handling peak traffic THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-5-second response times
3. WHEN scaling to 10+ concurrent hackathons THEN the system SHALL maintain performance standards
4. IF system load exceeds capacity THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation
5. WHEN processing real-time data THEN the system SHALL handle 1000+ events per minute through the hysteresis service
6. WHEN storing historical data THEN the system SHALL optimize for both write performance and query speed
