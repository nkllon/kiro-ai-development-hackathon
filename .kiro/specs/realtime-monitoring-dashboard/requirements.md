# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-time Monitoring Dashboard provides scenario-based monitoring interfaces for the Beast Mode development pipeline. The system adapts its display and alerting behavior based on user context and urgency levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Modal Display System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want different monitoring interfaces for different scenarios, so that I can choose the appropriate level of detail and interaction based on my current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm in "Whiskey Mode" THEN the system SHALL provide a beautiful terminal dashboard with ambient monitoring
2. WHEN I'm in "Page Me Mode" THEN the system SHALL send critical alerts via configured channels
3. WHEN I'm in "War Room Mode" THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive web-based dashboards
4. IF the system detects critical issues THEN it SHALL automatically escalate through appropriate channels

### Requirement 2: Whiskey Mode - Terminal Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer relaxing with a drink, I want a beautiful ambient terminal display, so that I can casually monitor system health without active engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Whiskey Mode is active THEN the system SHALL display real-time test results in a terminal UI
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the display SHALL show satisfying green animations and metrics
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the display SHALL show attention-getting but non-intrusive red indicators
4. IF hubris patterns are detected THEN the display SHALL show "Mama Discovery Protocol" activations

### Requirement 3: Page Me Mode - Critical Alerting

**User Story:** As an on-call engineer, I want immediate notifications for critical issues, so that I can respond quickly to system problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical test failures occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts via configured channels
2. WHEN hubris prevention systems activate THEN the system SHALL escalate to accountability chains
3. WHEN emergency claims are rejected THEN the system SHALL notify governance teams
4. IF system health degrades below thresholds THEN the system SHALL page responsible parties

### Requirement 4: War Room Mode - Comprehensive Dashboard

**User Story:** As an incident commander, I want comprehensive real-time visibility into all system metrics, so that I can coordinate response efforts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN War Room Mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide web-based dashboards with full metrics
2. WHEN multiple team members access the dashboard THEN they SHALL see synchronized real-time updates
3. WHEN drilling down into specific issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed context and history
4. IF coordination is needed THEN the dashboard SHALL support collaborative features

### Requirement 5: Event Stream Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all monitoring modes to consume the same event stream, so that I can ensure consistency across different interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filesystem events occur THEN all monitoring modes SHALL receive the same base data
2. WHEN test results are generated THEN they SHALL be distributed to all active monitoring interfaces
3. WHEN hubris prevention events occur THEN they SHALL be visible across all monitoring modes
4. IF event processing fails THEN the system SHALL maintain monitoring continuity
