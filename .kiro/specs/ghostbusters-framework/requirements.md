# Ghostbusters Framework Requirements

## Introduction

The Ghostbusters Framework provides integration and coordination services for the specialized analysis and recovery services. This framework focuses on orchestrating interactions between Code Analysis Agents, Build Test Agents, Recovery Engine Framework, and other specialized services to provide cohesive development workflow automation.

**Single Responsibility:** Integration and coordination of specialized analysis and recovery services
**Dependencies:** 
- Document Validation Service
- Multi-Agent Consensus Engine  
- Code Analysis Agents
- Build Test Agents
- Recovery Engine Framework

**Architectural Position:** This spec serves as an integration layer that coordinates specialized services. It depends on foundational services but provides integrated workflows for consumer specs.

## Stakeholder Personas

### Primary Stakeholder: "Multi-Agent System Orchestrator" (The Framework Itself)
**Role:** Foundational Intelligence Layer for All Development Workflows
**Goals:**
- Provide consistent expert agent capabilities across all system specifications
- Enable intelligent detection and recovery from code quality, security, and build issues
- Orchestrate multi-agent consensus for complex decision-making scenarios
- Maintain systematic validation and confidence scoring for all automated actions

**Pain Points:**
- Currently referenced by multiple specs but not formally defined as foundational dependency
- Inconsistent agent capabilities and interfaces across different use cases
- Lack of standardized recovery engine patterns and validation frameworks
- No clear orchestration model for multi-agent workflows

**Success Criteria:**
- Single, authoritative definition of all expert agents and their capabilities
- Standardized recovery engine patterns used consistently across all dependent specs
- Clear orchestration framework for multi-agent decision-making and validation
- Well-defined service interfaces that prevent circular dependencies with dependent specs

### Secondary Stakeholder: "Development Workflow Consumer" (Dependent Specs)
**Role:** Specs that consume Ghostbusters capabilities (Beast Mode, Git DevOps, Devpost Integration)
**Goals:**
- Access consistent expert agent capabilities for their specific domains
- Leverage recovery engines for systematic problem resolution
- Use validation frameworks for confidence scoring and quality assurance
- Integrate multi-agent orchestration into their workflows

**Pain Points:**
- Unclear which Ghostbusters capabilities are available for consumption
- Inconsistent interfaces and patterns across different expert agents
- Difficulty integrating multi-agent workflows into spec-specific processes
- Risk of circular dependencies when trying to extend Ghostbusters capabilities

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear service interfaces for all Ghostbusters capabilities
- Consistent patterns for integrating expert agents into dependent workflows
- Well-defined extension points for spec-specific agent customization
- Guaranteed DAG compliance in dependency relationships
