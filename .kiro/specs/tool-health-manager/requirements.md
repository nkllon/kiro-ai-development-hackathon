# Tool Health Manager Requirements

## Introduction

The Tool Health Manager provides systematic tool diagnosis, repair, and health monitoring capabilities. This component focuses exclusively on the "fix tools first" principle, ensuring that development tools work correctly before proceeding with development tasks. It provides systematic tool repair rather than workarounds, maintaining tool health across the development environment.

**Single Responsibility:** Diagnose, repair, and monitor the health of development tools systematically.

## Dependency Architecture

**Foundation Dependency:** This specification depends on the Ghostbusters Framework for expert agents (SecurityExpert, BuildExpert) and recovery engines.

**Dependency Relationship:**
```
Ghostbusters Framework (Foundation)
    ↓
Tool Health Manager (This Spec)
    ↓
[Beast Mode Core, Git DevOps Pipeline, etc.] (Consumers)
```

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Tool Diagnosis

**User Story:** As a tool health manager, I want to systematically diagnose tool failures, so that I can identify root causes rather than symptoms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I encounter a broken tool THEN I SHALL diagnose the root cause systematically
2. WHEN diagnosing tool failures THEN I SHALL check installation integrity, dependencies, configuration, and version compatibility
3. WHEN diagnosis is performed THEN I SHALL use Ghostbusters expert agents for comprehensive analysis
4. WHEN multiple issues are detected THEN I SHALL prioritize fixes based on systematic impact analysis
5. WHEN diagnosis completes THEN I SHALL provide detailed root cause analysis with confidence scoring

### Requirement 2: Systematic Tool Repair

**User Story:** As a tool health manager, I want to fix actual tool problems systematically, so that I can demonstrate the "fix tools first" principle instead of implementing workarounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing tools THEN I SHALL repair the actual problem, not implement workarounds
2. WHEN tools are fixed THEN I SHALL validate the fix works before proceeding
3. WHEN tool fixes are successful THEN I SHALL document the pattern for future prevention
4. WHEN repairs fail THEN I SHALL escalate to systematic RCA and expert human intervention
5. WHEN fixes are applied THEN I SHALL use Ghostbusters recovery engines for systematic remediation

### Requirement 3: Tool Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a tool health manager, I want to continuously monitor tool health, so that I can prevent failures before they impact development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring tools THEN I SHALL continuously assess health status and performance metrics
2. WHEN degradation is detected THEN I SHALL proactively initiate systematic diagnosis and repair
3. WHEN health metrics are collected THEN I SHALL provide operational visibility for external systems
4. WHEN tools are healthy THEN I SHALL maintain baseline performance measurements for comparison
5. WHEN health patterns emerge THEN I SHALL learn and predict potential failures before they occur

### Requirement 4: Makefile Health Management

**User Story:** As a tool health manager, I want to ensure Beast Mode's own Makefile works perfectly, so that I can prove the "fix tools first" principle through self-application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my own Makefile is executed THEN it SHALL work without errors (proving I can fix my own tools)
2. WHEN Makefile issues are detected THEN I SHALL diagnose missing files, broken targets, and dependency issues
3. WHEN fixing Makefile problems THEN I SHALL create proper modular structure, not workarounds
4. WHEN Makefile repairs are complete THEN I SHALL validate all make targets work correctly
5. WHEN Makefile health is restored THEN I SHALL measure and document systematic vs ad-hoc repair performance

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### DR1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing tool health diagnostics THEN diagnosis SHALL complete within 30 seconds for common tool failures
2. WHEN monitoring tool health THEN health checks SHALL complete within 5 seconds for 95% of tools
3. WHEN repairing tools THEN systematic fixes SHALL be applied within 60 seconds for standard issues
4. WHEN validating tool fixes THEN validation SHALL complete within 10 seconds
5. WHEN scaling monitoring THEN system SHALL handle health checks for 100+ tools without performance degradation

### DR2: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tool diagnosis fails THEN system SHALL provide graceful degradation with manual intervention guidance
2. WHEN repair attempts fail THEN system SHALL never leave tools in a worse state than before repair
3. WHEN monitoring systems fail THEN tool health status SHALL degrade gracefully with appropriate alerts
4. WHEN under load THEN system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for critical tool health services
5. WHEN tools cannot be repaired THEN system SHALL provide clear escalation paths and workaround documentation
