# Code Analysis Agents Requirements

## Introduction

The Code Analysis Agents provide specialized expert analysis for security, code quality, and architecture domains. This service focuses exclusively on code analysis without orchestration, recovery, or consensus concerns, delegating those to appropriate specialized services.

**Single Responsibility:** Domain-specific code analysis only
**Dependencies:** Multi-Agent Consensus Engine (for conflict resolution)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Analysis Agent

**User Story:** As a code analysis system, I want specialized security analysis, so that security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns can be detected systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN SecurityExpert SHALL detect security vulnerabilities using systematic patterns
2. WHEN security issues are found THEN the agent SHALL classify severity and provide remediation guidance
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN SecurityExpert SHALL provide confidence scores for all findings
4. WHEN uncertain findings occur THEN the agent SHALL escalate to Multi-Agent Consensus Engine
5. WHEN security patterns evolve THEN the agent SHALL update detection capabilities accordingly

### Requirement 2: Code Quality Analysis Agent

**User Story:** As a code analysis system, I want specialized code quality analysis, so that quality issues and anti-patterns can be detected systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN CodeQualityExpert SHALL detect quality issues using established patterns
2. WHEN quality problems are found THEN the agent SHALL provide specific improvement recommendations
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN CodeQualityExpert SHALL provide detailed quality metrics
4. WHEN conflicting quality assessments occur THEN the agent SHALL use Multi-Agent Consensus Engine
5. WHEN quality standards change THEN the agent SHALL adapt analysis criteria appropriately

### Requirement 3: Architecture Analysis Agent

**User Story:** As a code analysis system, I want specialized architecture analysis, so that architectural violations and design issues can be detected systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN ArchitectureExpert SHALL detect architectural anti-patterns and violations
2. WHEN architectural issues are found THEN the agent SHALL provide design improvement guidance
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN ArchitectureExpert SHALL validate architectural compliance
4. WHEN architectural conflicts arise THEN the agent SHALL leverage Multi-Agent Consensus Engine
5. WHEN architectural standards evolve THEN the agent SHALL update validation criteria

### Requirement 4: Pattern Recognition and Learning

**User Story:** As a code analysis system, I want pattern recognition capabilities, so that analysis accuracy improves over time through systematic learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis patterns are successful THEN agents SHALL learn and improve future detection accuracy
2. WHEN false positives occur THEN agents SHALL adjust detection patterns based on corrections
3. WHEN new code patterns emerge THEN agents SHALL adapt analysis capabilities systematically
4. WHEN pattern libraries grow THEN they SHALL be shared across all analysis agents
5. WHEN learning occurs THEN it SHALL maintain consistency with Multi-Agent Consensus Engine

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN analysis SHALL complete within 2 seconds for files up to 1000 lines
2. WHEN concurrent analysis occurs THEN agents SHALL handle 50+ simultaneous analysis requests
3. WHEN large codebases are processed THEN memory usage SHALL remain under 200MB per analysis
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN agents SHALL maintain core analysis functionality
5. WHEN load increases THEN response times SHALL degrade gracefully with appropriate feedback
