# Spec Framework Implementation Plan

## Core Document Management Implementation

- [ ] 1. Set up project structure and document data models
  - Create directory structure for document management components (models, validators, lifecycle)
  - Implement core data model classes: SpecificationDocument, Dependency, ValidationResult
  - Write unit tests for data model validation and serialization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Implement document storage and file operations
  - Create DocumentRepository with file-based storage implementation
  - Implement CRUD operations for specification documents with atomic file operations
  - Add basic version tracking for document changes
  - Write unit tests for file operations and data persistence
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 3. Build document structure validator
  - Implement DocumentValidator class with structure validation methods
  - Create EARS format validation for requirements acceptance criteria
  - Add completeness checking for required document sections (Introduction, Requirements, etc.)
  - Write unit tests for validation logic and error reporting
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [ ] 4. Create dependency DAG management
  - Implement DependencyManager class with DAG validation
  - Create DependencyGraph data structure with cycle detection algorithms
  - Add circular dependency detection and resolution guidance
  - Write unit tests for DAG validation and cycle detection
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement CLI interface for document operations
  - Create command-line interface for document validation and dependency checking
  - Add commands for document creation, validation, and dependency analysis
  - Implement user-friendly error reporting with specific remediation guidance
  - Write integration tests for CLI workflows
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.5_

## Document Lifecycle and Integration

- [ ] 6. Implement document lifecycle management
  - Create DocumentLifecycleManager with document creation and update workflows
  - Add semantic versioning support for document changes
  - Implement change tracking and audit trails for document modifications
  - Write unit tests for lifecycle operations and version management
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Build integration with foundational services
  - Integrate with Document Validation Service for enhanced structure and format validation
  - Add Multi-Agent Consensus Engine integration for low-confidence validation decisions
  - Implement fallback mechanisms when foundational services are unavailable
  - Write integration tests for Document Validation Service and Multi-Agent Consensus Engine interaction
  - _Requirements: Foundation dependency integration_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive error handling and user guidance
  - Implement specific error handling for validation and dependency failures
  - Add detailed remediation guidance for common document structure issues
  - Create user-friendly error messages with examples and templates
  - Write unit tests for error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.5_

## Final Integration and Testing

- [ ] 9. Conduct end-to-end integration testing
  - Create comprehensive test suite covering document creation, validation, and dependency workflows
  - Test integration with existing specs (Beast Mode, PDCA Orchestrator, etc.)
  - Validate performance targets with realistic document loads (10s validation, 5s dependency analysis)
  - Write integration tests for CLI and API interfaces
  - _Requirements: Derived Requirements 1.1-1.5, 2.1-2.5_

- [ ] 10. Implement performance optimization and monitoring
  - Add performance monitoring for document validation and dependency analysis operations
  - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed documents and validation results
  - Create concurrent validation handling for multiple document operations
  - Write performance tests to validate 10-second validation and 5-second dependency analysis targets
  - _Requirements: Derived Requirements 1.1-1.5, 2.1-2.5_
