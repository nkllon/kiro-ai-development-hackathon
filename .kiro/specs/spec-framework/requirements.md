# Spec Framework Requirements

## Introduction

The Spec Framework provides specification document management, validation, and dependency governance services. This component focuses exclusively on specification document lifecycle, format validation, and dependency DAG enforcement. It ensures specifications follow proper structure, maintain quality standards, and avoid circular dependencies while providing the foundational document management layer.

**Single Responsibility:** Manage specification documents, validate format and structure, and enforce dependency governance.

## Dependency Architecture

**Foundation Dependencies:** This specification depends on focused foundational services:
- Document Validation Service (for structure and format validation)
- Multi-Agent Consensus Engine (for low-confidence decision resolution)

**Dependency Relationship:**
```
Document Validation Service (Foundation)
Multi-Agent Consensus Engine (Foundation)
    ↓
Spec Framework (This Spec)
    ↓
[All Other Specs] (Consumers)
```

**Service Boundaries:** Spec Framework provides document management services to other specs but does NOT handle PDCA orchestration (Systematic PDCA Orchestrator), metrics collection (Systematic Metrics Engine), or parallel execution (Parallel DAG Orchestrator).



## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Specification Document Structure Validation

**User Story:** As a specification framework, I want to validate specification document structure and format, so that all specifications follow consistent patterns and maintain quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications are created THEN they SHALL follow standardized structure with Introduction, Requirements, Design, and Tasks sections
2. WHEN requirements are written THEN they SHALL use EARS format with clear user stories and acceptance criteria
3. WHEN documents are validated THEN format compliance SHALL be checked automatically with specific error reporting
4. WHEN validation fails THEN specific remediation guidance SHALL be provided with examples
5. WHEN documents are approved THEN they SHALL meet all structural and format quality gates

### Requirement 2: Dependency DAG Enforcement

**User Story:** As a specification framework, I want to enforce DAG compliance in specification dependencies, so that circular dependencies are prevented and architectural integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new specifications are created THEN dependency relationships SHALL be validated to ensure DAG compliance
2. WHEN dependency conflicts are detected THEN automated validation SHALL prevent specification approval until conflicts are resolved
3. WHEN dependency graphs are analyzed THEN they SHALL show clear hierarchical relationships without circular references
4. WHEN specifications reference other specs THEN references SHALL be validated for proper service interface usage
5. WHEN DAG violations occur THEN specific resolution guidance SHALL be provided with dependency restructuring recommendations

### Requirement 3: Document Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a specification framework, I want to manage specification document lifecycle, so that documents evolve systematically while maintaining version control and traceability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications are created THEN they SHALL follow systematic workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks
2. WHEN specifications are updated THEN changes SHALL be tracked with version control and impact analysis
3. WHEN specifications are deprecated THEN migration documentation SHALL be generated for dependent specifications
4. WHEN document versions are managed THEN semantic versioning SHALL be used with automated changelog generation
5. WHEN lifecycle events occur THEN they SHALL be tracked with comprehensive audit trails

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Document Validation Performance

**User Story:** As a specification framework, I want to provide fast document validation, so that specification development workflows remain efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications are validated THEN structure and format checks SHALL complete within 10 seconds for standard specifications
2. WHEN dependency analysis is performed THEN DAG validation SHALL complete within 5 seconds for dependency graphs up to 100 specifications
3. WHEN document searches are performed THEN results SHALL be returned within 1 second for 95% of queries
4. WHEN validation reports are generated THEN they SHALL be produced within 5 seconds for standard documents
5. WHEN concurrent validations occur THEN system SHALL handle 20+ simultaneous document validations without degradation

### Derived Requirement 2: Document Management Reliability

**User Story:** As a specification framework, I want to provide reliable document management, so that specification development is not disrupted by framework issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation services fail THEN document development SHALL continue with cached validation results
2. WHEN dependency analysis fails THEN manual dependency review processes SHALL be triggered with clear guidance
3. WHEN document storage fails THEN local backup mechanisms SHALL preserve work in progress
4. WHEN framework updates occur THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing documents
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN specific remediation guidance SHALL be provided with examples
