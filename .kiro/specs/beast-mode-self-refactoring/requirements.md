# Beast Mode Self-Refactoring Orchestration Requirements

## Introduction

We face the ultimate meta-challenge: refactoring Beast Mode from monolithic to RM-compliant architecture **while actively using Beast Mode** to perform the refactoring. This is like performing open-heart surgery on yourself while running a marathon - we need systematic orchestration to avoid breaking the system we're using to fix the system.

**The Paradox:** We need Beast Mode to refactor Beast Mode, but Beast Mode is currently broken/monolithic and needs refactoring.

**The Solution:** Systematic self-refactoring orchestration with parallel execution, dependency management, and graceful migration strategies.

## Stakeholder Personas

### Primary Stakeholder: "Meta-Refactoring Engineer" (The Bootstrap Problem Solver)
**Role:** Engineer attempting to refactor a system using the system itself
**Goals:**
- Refactor Beast Mode from monolithic to RM-compliant without breaking active usage
- Implement dependent specs first to avoid circular dependency hell
- Parallelize the refactoring process to avoid "second coming" timeline
- Maintain system functionality throughout the transition

**Pain Points:**
- Can't break Beast Mode while using Beast Mode to fix Beast Mode
- Dependency chains are complex and interdependent
- Sequential implementation would take forever
- Need to bootstrap new architecture while old one is still running

**Success Criteria:**
- Successful migration from monolithic to RM-compliant architecture
- Zero downtime during refactoring process
- Parallel execution reduces timeline from months to weeks
- All functionality preserved throughout transition

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dependency-First Implementation Strategy

**User Story:** As a meta-refactoring engineer, I want to implement foundation dependencies first, so that I can build the new architecture on solid ground without circular dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting refactoring THEN I SHALL implement Ghostbusters Framework components first as the foundation layer
2. WHEN Ghostbusters is stable THEN I SHALL implement specialized Beast Mode components (PDCA Orchestrator, Tool Health Manager, etc.) in parallel
3. WHEN specialized components are ready THEN I SHALL implement Beast Mode Core as the integration hub
4. WHEN all components exist THEN I SHALL implement Integrated Beast Mode System as the unified coordinator
5. WHEN new architecture is validated THEN I SHALL migrate from monolithic to RM-compliant architecture

### Requirement 2: Parallel Execution Orchestration

**User Story:** As a meta-refactoring engineer, I want to execute independent refactoring tasks in parallel, so that I can avoid "second coming" timeline scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing refactoring tasks THEN I SHALL identify all tasks that can be executed independently in parallel
2. WHEN parallel opportunities exist THEN I SHALL launch multiple Kiro agents with branch parameters for concurrent execution
3. WHEN using parallel execution THEN I SHALL maintain systematic approach and constraint satisfaction across all agents
4. WHEN parallel tasks complete THEN I SHALL merge results systematically with validation and conflict resolution
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN I SHALL use both local execution and cloud scaling (GKE Cloud Functions) based on complexity

### Requirement 3: Live System Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a meta-refactoring engineer, I want to migrate from monolithic to RM-compliant architecture without breaking the running system, so that I can maintain Beast Mode functionality throughout refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN I SHALL implement new RM-compliant versions alongside existing monolithic code
2. WHEN new components are ready THEN I SHALL gradually route traffic from monolithic to RM-compliant implementations
3. WHEN routing traffic THEN I SHALL maintain backward compatibility and graceful fallback to monolithic code if needed
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN I SHALL validate all functionality works through RM-compliant architecture
5. WHEN validation passes THEN I SHALL deprecate and remove monolithic implementations

### Requirement 4: Bootstrap Orchestration System

**User Story:** As a meta-refactoring engineer, I want a bootstrap orchestration system that can manage the refactoring process, so that I can systematically coordinate the meta-refactoring without manual chaos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting refactoring THEN I SHALL create a bootstrap orchestrator that can manage the refactoring process
2. WHEN orchestrating refactoring THEN I SHALL use existing Beast Mode capabilities where they work and implement new ones where needed
3. WHEN coordinating tasks THEN I SHALL maintain dependency order while maximizing parallel execution opportunities
4. WHEN managing the process THEN I SHALL provide real-time status, progress tracking, and issue resolution
5. WHEN refactoring completes THEN I SHALL validate the bootstrap orchestrator can be replaced by the new RM-compliant architecture

### Requirement 5: Systematic Validation and Rollback

**User Story:** As a meta-refactoring engineer, I want comprehensive validation and rollback capabilities, so that I can safely attempt the refactoring without risking complete system failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new components THEN I SHALL validate they work correctly before integrating with the system
2. WHEN migrating functionality THEN I SHALL maintain rollback capabilities to previous working state
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN I SHALL automatically rollback to last known good configuration
4. WHEN validation fails THEN I SHALL provide detailed diagnostics and systematic remediation guidance
5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN I SHALL restore full functionality within 60 seconds

### Requirement 6: Parallel Branch Management

**User Story:** As a meta-refactoring engineer, I want sophisticated branch management for parallel development, so that I can coordinate multiple teams working on different components simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating parallel tasks THEN I SHALL assign each task to a specific branch with clear scope and boundaries
2. WHEN managing branches THEN I SHALL prevent conflicts through systematic branch isolation and coordination
3. WHEN merging branches THEN I SHALL use systematic merge strategies with automated conflict resolution
4. WHEN coordinating work THEN I SHALL provide real-time visibility into all parallel development streams
5. WHEN integration is needed THEN I SHALL orchestrate systematic integration testing across all branches

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### DR1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing parallel refactoring THEN total timeline SHALL be reduced by at least 70% compared to sequential approach
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN dependency analysis SHALL complete within 30 seconds for complex dependency graphs
3. WHEN orchestrating tasks THEN task coordination overhead SHALL be <10% of total execution time
4. WHEN validating components THEN validation SHALL complete within 5 minutes for standard components
5. WHEN rolling back THEN rollback operations SHALL complete within 60 seconds

### DR2: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is in progress THEN system SHALL maintain 99% uptime for critical Beast Mode functionality
2. WHEN parallel execution fails THEN system SHALL isolate failures and continue with remaining parallel tasks
3. WHEN migration issues occur THEN system SHALL automatically fallback to working monolithic implementation
4. WHEN coordination fails THEN system SHALL provide manual intervention capabilities with clear guidance
5. WHEN validation detects issues THEN system SHALL prevent deployment of broken components

### DR3: Scalability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parallel execution is needed THEN system SHALL support up to 20 concurrent refactoring agents
2. WHEN using cloud scaling THEN system SHALL automatically provision GKE Cloud Functions based on task complexity
3. WHEN managing branches THEN system SHALL handle up to 50 parallel development branches without performance degradation
4. WHEN coordinating work THEN system SHALL scale coordination overhead linearly with number of parallel tasks
5. WHEN integration testing THEN system SHALL support testing of up to 100 component combinations in parallel

## Implementation Strategy
