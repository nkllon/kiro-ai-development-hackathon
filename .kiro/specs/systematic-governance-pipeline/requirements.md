# Systematic Governance Pipeline Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a Snowflake-inspired systematic governance pipeline that provides full traceability, lineage, and security for software development workflows. The system implements the principle "You drop requirements in my stage, I got it" - ensuring complete systematic processing with no magical mystery artifacts.

**ðŸŽ¯ Core Philosophy: "Snowflake-Level Systematic Governance"**

Just as Snowflake provides full data lineage and governance, our systematic pipeline provides complete requirement-to-implementation traceability with built-in quality assurance, security, and systematic processing at every stage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to drop requirements into the systematic pipeline and receive full traceability and governance, so that I can trust the systematic processing without magical mystery artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are submitted to the pipeline THEN the system SHALL provide immediate acknowledgment with tracking ID and systematic processing plan
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL create complete lineage tracking from requirement to final implementation
3. WHEN each stage completes THEN the system SHALL provide transparent status updates with systematic validation results
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL deliver full audit trail with traceability from requirement to implementation
5. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide systematic root cause analysis with clear remediation paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want systematic governance at every pipeline stage, so that quality, security, and compliance are built-in rather than bolted-on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements enter the pipeline THEN the system SHALL validate completeness, clarity, and systematic format compliance
2. WHEN design is generated THEN the system SHALL enforce architectural standards, security requirements, and systematic design principles
3. WHEN implementation begins THEN the system SHALL apply systematic coding standards, security scanning, and quality gates
4. WHEN testing occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure >90% coverage requirements and systematic validation across all dimensions
5. WHEN deployment happens THEN the system SHALL provide systematic security attestation and compliance certification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want complete visibility into the systematic pipeline processing, so that I can understand exactly how requirements become implementations without any black box operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing pipeline status THEN the system SHALL provide real-time visibility into all processing stages with systematic metrics
2. WHEN examining lineage THEN the system SHALL show complete traceability from original requirement through every transformation
3. WHEN reviewing decisions THEN the system SHALL provide systematic rationale for all architectural and implementation choices
4. WHEN auditing results THEN the system SHALL offer comprehensive reports with evidence and systematic validation results
5. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL provide systematic root cause analysis with complete context and remediation guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want systematic security governance throughout the pipeline, so that security is systematically enforced rather than manually checked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are processed THEN the system SHALL identify and flag security implications with systematic threat modeling
2. WHEN design is created THEN the system SHALL enforce security-by-design principles with systematic security architecture validation
3. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL apply systematic security scanning, vulnerability detection, and secure coding standards
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL provide systematic security attestation with comprehensive security validation
5. WHEN monitoring begins THEN the system SHALL implement systematic security monitoring with automated threat detection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance manager, I want systematic compliance governance built into the pipeline, so that regulatory requirements are systematically met without manual compliance checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements include compliance needs THEN the system SHALL systematically map requirements to regulatory standards
2. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL enforce compliance requirements at every stage with systematic validation
3. WHEN documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL create systematic compliance documentation with audit trails
4. WHEN audits occur THEN the system SHALL provide systematic compliance reports with complete evidence and traceability
5. WHEN compliance changes THEN the system SHALL systematically update all affected components with impact analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development engineer, I want the systematic pipeline to handle complexity transparently, so that I can focus on creative problem-solving while the system handles systematic processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting complex requirements THEN the system SHALL systematically break down complexity into manageable systematic components
2. WHEN dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL systematically identify, track, and manage all interdependencies
3. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide systematic conflict resolution with clear decision rationale
4. WHEN changes occur THEN the system SHALL systematically propagate changes with impact analysis and validation
5. WHEN integration happens THEN the system SHALL systematically coordinate all components with comprehensive integration testing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the systematic pipeline to be self-managing and self-healing, so that systematic processing continues reliably without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load increases THEN the pipeline SHALL systematically scale resources to maintain performance targets
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL systematically diagnose issues and apply automatic recovery procedures
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL systematically identify bottlenecks and optimize processing
4. WHEN maintenance is needed THEN the system SHALL systematically schedule and execute maintenance with minimal disruption
5. WHEN monitoring detects issues THEN the system SHALL systematically alert operators with actionable diagnostic information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an enterprise architect, I want the systematic pipeline to integrate with existing enterprise systems, so that systematic governance extends across the entire development ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN the pipeline SHALL systematically map and synchronize with enterprise data sources
2. WHEN enterprise policies change THEN the system SHALL systematically update pipeline governance to reflect new requirements
3. WHEN reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL systematically generate enterprise-compatible reports with standard formats
4. WHEN auditing occurs THEN the system SHALL systematically coordinate with enterprise audit systems and compliance frameworks
5. WHEN scaling enterprise-wide THEN the system SHALL systematically support multi-team, multi-project governance with proper isolation

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the systematic pipeline to process requirements efficiently, so that systematic governance doesn't slow down development velocity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are submitted THEN initial processing SHALL complete within 30 seconds for standard complexity requirements
2. WHEN design generation occurs THEN systematic design SHALL complete within 5 minutes for typical project scope
3. WHEN implementation begins THEN systematic code generation SHALL maintain >1000 lines per minute processing speed
4. WHEN validation runs THEN systematic quality checks SHALL complete within 2 minutes for standard codebases
5. WHEN the system scales THEN performance SHALL maintain targets with up to 100 concurrent requirement processing workflows

### Derived Requirement 2: Reliability Requirements

**User Story:** As a mission-critical development organization, I want 99.9% uptime for the systematic pipeline, so that development workflows are never blocked by systematic governance failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system failures occur THEN recovery SHALL complete within 5 minutes with no data loss
2. WHEN maintenance is performed THEN the system SHALL provide zero-downtime updates with systematic rollback capability
3. WHEN load spikes occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle 10x normal load without service degradation
