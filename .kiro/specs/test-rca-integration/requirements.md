# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the existing RCA (Root Cause Analysis) engine with the make test command to provide automatic failure analysis when tests fail. The system will automatically detect test failures, trigger comprehensive RCA analysis, and provide actionable insights to developers for quick resolution. This builds upon the existing Beast Mode RCA engine and testing infrastructure to create a seamless developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the make test command to automatically trigger RCA analysis when tests fail, so that I can quickly understand and fix the root cause of test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN make test is executed AND tests fail THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger RCA analysis
2. WHEN RCA analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of root causes and suggested fixes
3. WHEN multiple test failures occur THEN the system SHALL analyze each failure and group related issues
4. WHEN RCA analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 30 seconds for typical test failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed RCA reports for test failures, so that I can understand the systematic fixes needed rather than just symptoms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test failures are analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive factor analysis including tool health, dependencies, and configuration
2. WHEN root causes are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest systematic fixes with implementation steps
3. WHEN RCA reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include validation criteria to verify fixes address root causes
4. WHEN prevention patterns are available THEN the system SHALL suggest preventive measures for similar failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access RCA functionality through make commands, so that I can integrate failure analysis into my existing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run make test THEN the system SHALL automatically include RCA on failures
2. WHEN I run make rca THEN the system SHALL perform RCA analysis on the most recent test failures
3. WHEN I run make rca TASK=<task_id> THEN the system SHALL perform RCA analysis on a specific task or test
4. WHEN RCA commands are executed THEN the system SHALL provide consistent output formatting and logging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RCA analysis to integrate with the existing Beast Mode framework, so that I can leverage existing pattern libraries and systematic approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RCA analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL use the existing RCAEngine from beast_mode.analysis
2. WHEN pattern matching is performed THEN the system SHALL achieve sub-second performance for existing pattern libraries
3. WHEN systematic fixes are generated THEN the system SHALL follow Beast Mode principles of addressing root causes not symptoms
4. WHEN prevention patterns are documented THEN the system SHALL add them to the existing pattern library for future use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RCA integration to work with different types of test failures, so that I can get meaningful analysis regardless of the failure type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pytest failures occur THEN the system SHALL analyze Python-specific issues including imports, dependencies, and syntax
2. WHEN make target failures occur THEN the system SHALL analyze Makefile issues, missing files, and build dependencies
3. WHEN infrastructure failures occur THEN the system SHALL analyze system configuration, permissions, and environmental factors
4. WHEN unknown failure types occur THEN the system SHALL perform generic comprehensive analysis and suggest investigation steps
