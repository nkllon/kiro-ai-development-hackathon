# Multi-Language Build Orchestration Requirements

## Introduction

The Multi-Language Build Orchestration System provides unified build, test, and deployment coordination across heterogeneous technology stacks. This system enables systematic development workflows while allowing optimal technology choices for specific use cases (Python for AI/ML, Node.js for document processing, Go for performance, etc.).

**Single Responsibility:** Orchestrate builds, tests, and quality gates across multiple programming languages
**Architectural Position:** Foundation service that other language-specific specs depend on
**Scope:** Make-based orchestration supporting Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, and Java stacks

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Language Project Detection

**User Story:** As a build system, I want to automatically detect projects in different programming languages, so that I can orchestrate builds without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the project directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect Python projects (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt)
2. WHEN scanning the project directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect Node.js projects (package.json)
3. WHEN scanning the project directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect Go projects (go.mod)
4. WHEN scanning the project directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect Rust projects (Cargo.toml)
5. WHEN scanning the project directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect Java projects (pom.xml, build.gradle)
6. WHEN projects are detected THEN the system SHALL exclude dependency directories (node_modules, .venv, target)

### Requirement 2: Unified Build Orchestration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single command to build all projects regardless of technology stack, so that I can maintain consistent development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing `make build-all` THEN the system SHALL build all detected projects in dependency order
2. WHEN building Python projects THEN the system SHALL use uv/pip for dependency installation and package building
3. WHEN building Node.js projects THEN the system SHALL use npm/yarn for dependency installation and TypeScript compilation
4. WHEN building Go projects THEN the system SHALL use go build with proper module handling
5. WHEN building Rust projects THEN the system SHALL use cargo build with dependency management
6. WHEN building Java projects THEN the system SHALL use Maven/Gradle with proper dependency resolution

### Requirement 3: Cross-Language Testing Coordination

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want unified test execution with >90% coverage enforcement across all languages, so that quality standards are consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing `make test-all` THEN the system SHALL run tests for all detected projects
2. WHEN testing Python projects THEN the system SHALL enforce >90% coverage using pytest and coverage tools
3. WHEN testing Node.js projects THEN the system SHALL enforce >90% coverage using Jest or Mocha with coverage thresholds
4. WHEN testing Go projects THEN the system SHALL enforce >90% coverage using go test with race detection
5. WHEN testing Rust projects THEN the system SHALL enforce >90% coverage using cargo tarpaulin
6. WHEN any project fails coverage threshold THEN the system SHALL fail the entire test suite with detailed reporting

### Requirement 4: Universal Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a development team, I want consistent code quality enforcement across all programming languages, so that code standards are maintained regardless of technology choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing `make lint-all` THEN the system SHALL run language-specific linting tools on all projects
2. WHEN linting Python projects THEN the system SHALL use ruff, black, and mypy with consistent configuration
3. WHEN linting Node.js projects THEN the system SHALL use ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript compiler checks
4. WHEN linting Go projects THEN the system SHALL use golangci-lint, gofmt, and go vet
5. WHEN linting Rust projects THEN the system SHALL use cargo clippy and cargo fmt
6. WHEN any linting fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific file and line number feedback

### Requirement 5: Reflective Module Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations team, I want health monitoring across all services regardless of implementation language, so that I can maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN each SHALL expose standard health endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics)
2. WHEN executing `make health-all` THEN the system SHALL check health status of all running services
3. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL validate Reflective Module pattern compliance across languages
4. WHEN services are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
5. WHEN health monitoring fails THEN the system SHALL trigger systematic repair procedures
6. WHEN health status changes THEN the system SHALL log structured events for monitoring systems

### Requirement 6: Dependency Management Coordination

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want coordinated dependency management across all technology stacks, so that security and compatibility are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing `make install-all` THEN the system SHALL install dependencies for all detected projects
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use language-appropriate package managers (uv, npm, go mod, cargo)
3. WHEN dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL report conflicts with resolution suggestions
4. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL fail builds and provide remediation guidance
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility across language boundaries
6. WHEN dependency installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide systematic troubleshooting information

### Requirement 7: Parallel Execution Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast build times through parallel execution, so that development velocity is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building multiple projects THEN the system SHALL execute independent builds in parallel
2. WHEN dependencies exist between projects THEN the system SHALL respect build order while maximizing parallelism
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL adapt parallelism to available CPU cores
4. WHEN parallel builds fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear failure attribution to specific projects
5. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL report total time and per-project timing
6. WHEN parallel execution is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to sequential execution gracefully

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Specs

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want seamless integration with existing project specifications, so that the build system supports all planned components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Document Validation Service is built THEN the system SHALL handle Node.js/TypeScript build requirements
2. WHEN Beast Mode Framework is built THEN the system SHALL handle Python build requirements with RM compliance
3. WHEN CLI Implementation Standards are applied THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent CLI patterns across languages
4. WHEN Git DevOps Pipeline executes THEN the system SHALL provide build artifacts for deployment
5. WHEN Ghostbusters Framework runs THEN the system SHALL support AI agent deployment across language boundaries
6. WHEN quality gates execute THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing quality validation systems

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building all projects THEN total build time SHALL be <5 minutes for typical project sizes
2. WHEN running tests THEN parallel execution SHALL reduce total time by >50% compared to sequential

4. WHEN installing dependencies THEN caching SHALL reduce subsequent install times by >70%
5. WHEN builds fail THEN failure detection and reporting SHALL complete within 10 seconds

### Derived Requirement 2: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria
