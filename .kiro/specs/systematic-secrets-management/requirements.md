# Systematic Secrets Management Framework - Requirements

## Introduction

The Systematic Secrets Management Framework provides enterprise-grade secret lifecycle management for the Beast Mode ecosystem. This framework eliminates ad-hoc key management practices and establishes systematic, auditable, and secure secret handling across all environments and components.

**Core Principle**: "The walls of the fort are strong. It's safe in here." - Systematic security governance protects the entire development ecosystem through proper secret management.

## Requirements

1. WHEN a secret is created THEN the system SHALL assign an expiration date based on secret type policy
2. WHEN a secret approaches expiration (30 days) THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate rotation process
3. WHEN secret rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain both old and new versions during grace period
4. WHEN grace period expires THEN the system SHALL deactivate old secret version AND log the transition
5. IF rotation fails THEN the system SHALL alert administrators AND extend current secret validity AND retry rotation
6. WHEN emergency rotation is triggered THEN the system SHALL complete rotation within 5 minutes AND notify all affected services

### Requirement 3: Audit Trail and Compliance Tracking

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want complete audit trails of all secret operations, so that security incidents can be investigated and compliance requirements met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any secret operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log timestamp, user identity, operation type, secret identifier (not value), and result
2. WHEN secret access occurs THEN the system SHALL log requesting service, access time, and access result
3. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure logs are tamper-proof AND encrypted at rest
4. WHEN compliance reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate reports within 1 hour AND include all required audit data
5. IF suspicious access patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically flag for investigation AND alert security team
6. WHEN audit retention period expires THEN the system SHALL archive logs to long-term storage AND maintain retrieval capability

### Requirement 4: Beast Mode Integration and Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode operator, I want secrets management to integrate with PDCA cycles and provide health monitoring, so that secret system health is systematically maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN secrets management system starts THEN it SHALL implement Reflective Module pattern AND expose health endpoints
2. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify secret store connectivity, encryption key availability, and rotation service status
3. WHEN PDCA cycles execute THEN the system SHALL participate in systematic health assessment AND report secret-related metrics
4. IF secret system health degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger systematic repair processes AND escalate if repair fails
5. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL report secret rotation success rates, access patterns, and system performance
6. WHEN systematic maintenance occurs THEN the system SHALL coordinate with other Beast Mode components AND minimize service disruption

### Requirement 5: Developer Experience and Local Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless secret access during local development, so that I can work efficiently without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer requests development secrets THEN the system SHALL provide time-limited, scope-restricted access tokens
2. WHEN local development environment starts THEN the system SHALL automatically provision required development secrets
3. WHEN development session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke local secret access AND clear cached secrets
4. IF production secrets are requested in development THEN the system SHALL deny access AND provide development alternatives
5. WHEN developer authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL use multi-factor authentication AND log access
6. WHEN offline development is needed THEN the system SHALL provide encrypted local secret cache with automatic expiration

### Requirement 6: Emergency Access and Break-Glass Procedures

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want emergency access procedures for critical situations, so that system recovery is possible when normal processes fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emergency access is requested THEN the system SHALL require multi-person authorization AND document justification
2. WHEN break-glass access is granted THEN the system SHALL provide time-limited elevated access AND log all actions
3. WHEN emergency procedures activate THEN the system SHALL notify security team AND compliance officers immediately
4. IF emergency access is used THEN the system SHALL require post-incident review AND documentation of actions taken
5. WHEN emergency access expires THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke privileges AND generate incident report
6. WHEN system recovery occurs THEN the system SHALL validate all emergency actions AND restore normal security posture

### Requirement 7: Integration with External Secret Stores

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want integration with multiple secret storage backends, so that the system can adapt to different infrastructure requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HashiCorp Vault is configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with Vault API AND use Vault's native rotation capabilities
2. WHEN AWS Secrets Manager is configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with AWS API AND leverage AWS IAM for access control
3. WHEN Azure Key Vault is configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with Azure API AND use Azure AD for authentication
4. IF multiple backends are configured THEN the system SHALL route secrets to appropriate backend based on policy
5. WHEN backend failover occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to backup backend AND maintain service availability
6. WHEN backend synchronization is needed THEN the system SHALL replicate secrets across configured backends AND maintain consistency

### Requirement 8: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want secrets to be automatically provisioned in CI/CD pipelines, so that deployments can access required secrets without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD pipeline starts THEN the system SHALL provision pipeline-specific secrets based on deployment target
2. WHEN pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke pipeline secrets AND clean up temporary access
3. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL update target environment secrets AND verify deployment success
