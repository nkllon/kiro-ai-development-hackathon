# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an abstract Event/Polling Hysteresis Service that provides a systematic pattern for event-driven systems with polling fallback, reconciliation loops, and self-healing RCA. This meta-pattern can be reused across Beast Mode components to ensure reliable data flow with automatic failure detection and recovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Event-First Architecture Pattern

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a reusable service that prioritizes event-driven updates while providing polling fallback, so that all Beast Mode components can follow consistent event-first patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a data source THEN the system SHALL default to event-driven mode with polling as fallback
2. WHEN events are flowing normally THEN the system SHALL disable polling to reduce resource usage
3. WHEN event flow is interrupted THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to polling mode within 30 seconds
4. IF events resume THEN the system SHALL switch back to event-driven mode and disable polling
5. WHEN in hybrid mode THEN the system SHALL use events for real-time updates and polling for reconciliation
6. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL emit mode change events for monitoring

### Requirement 2: Hysteresis Loop Management

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want hysteresis loops that prevent oscillation between event and polling modes, so that the system remains stable during intermittent failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from events to polling THEN the system SHALL require 3 consecutive event failures before switching
2. WHEN switching from polling to events THEN the system SHALL require 5 consecutive successful events before switching
3. WHEN in transition state THEN the system SHALL use both modes temporarily to ensure data continuity
4. IF oscillation is detected THEN the system SHALL increase hysteresis thresholds exponentially
5. WHEN system is stable THEN the system SHALL gradually reduce hysteresis thresholds to normal levels
6. WHEN thresholds change THEN the system SHALL log the adjustment with reasoning

### Requirement 3: Reconciliation Engine

**User Story:** As a data integrity specialist, I want configurable reconciliation loops that detect and correct data inconsistencies, so that event-driven systems maintain accuracy despite failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring reconciliation THEN the system SHALL allow custom intervals per data type
2. WHEN running reconciliation THEN the system SHALL compare event-driven data with authoritative sources
3. WHEN discrepancies are found THEN the system SHALL emit correction events and log the differences
4. IF reconciliation fails THEN the system SHALL queue the failure for RCA analysis
5. WHEN correction events are emitted THEN the system SHALL verify the corrections were applied
6. WHEN reconciliation completes THEN the system SHALL update health metrics and emit status events

### Requirement 4: Self-Healing RCA Engine

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automatic root cause analysis and healing for event system failures, so that the system can recover from common issues without human intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL queue them for RCA analysis within 5 seconds
2. WHEN analyzing failures THEN the system SHALL gather context, identify patterns, and determine root causes
3. WHEN root causes are identified THEN the system SHALL attempt appropriate healing strategies
4. IF healing succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the success and update health metrics
5. WHEN healing fails THEN the system SHALL escalate to human intervention with detailed context
6. WHEN patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL learn and improve healing strategies over time

### Requirement 5: Event Stream Monitoring

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want comprehensive event stream health monitoring, so that I can detect and respond to event system degradation before it impacts users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are published THEN the system SHALL track publication success, latency, and delivery rates
2. WHEN monitoring streams THEN the system SHALL detect timeouts, delivery failures, and throughput anomalies
3. WHEN health degrades THEN the system SHALL emit alerts with severity levels and recommended actions
4. IF stream breaks are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery and log the attempt
5. WHEN recovery succeeds THEN the system SHALL verify stream health and resume normal monitoring
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide stream health metrics and trend analysis

### Requirement 6: Configurable Adaptation Strategies

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want configurable adaptation strategies for different data types and use cases, so that the hysteresis service can be tuned for optimal performance across diverse scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring strategies THEN the system SHALL allow custom thresholds, intervals, and healing approaches
2. WHEN adapting to load THEN the system SHALL adjust polling frequencies and event buffer sizes
3. WHEN detecting patterns THEN the system SHALL automatically tune parameters based on historical performance
4. IF custom strategies are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and integrate them safely
5. WHEN strategies change THEN the system SHALL A/B test new approaches against current baselines
6. WHEN optimization completes THEN the system SHALL persist successful configurations for reuse

### Requirement 7: Multi-Tenant Isolation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want multi-tenant isolation for event/polling configurations, so that different hackathons or projects can have independent hysteresis behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tenants THEN the system SHALL provide isolated event streams and polling schedules
2. WHEN one tenant fails THEN the system SHALL not impact other tenants' event/polling behavior
3. WHEN scaling tenants THEN the system SHALL allocate resources fairly and prevent resource starvation
4. IF tenant limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation per tenant
5. WHEN monitoring tenants THEN the system SHALL provide per-tenant metrics and health dashboards
6. WHEN tenants are removed THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and archive historical data

### Requirement 8: Integration API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple integration API that allows Beast Mode components to easily adopt the event/polling hysteresis pattern, so that I can focus on business logic rather than reliability infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating components THEN the system SHALL provide simple configuration and callback interfaces
2. WHEN registering data sources THEN the system SHALL auto-detect event capabilities and configure appropriately
3. WHEN handling callbacks THEN the system SHALL provide error handling, retry logic, and circuit breakers
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery guidance
5. WHEN components start THEN the system SHALL perform health checks and validate configurations
6. WHEN providing examples THEN the system SHALL include common integration patterns and best practices

### Requirement 9: Observability and Debugging

**User Story:** As a system debugger, I want comprehensive observability into hysteresis loop behavior, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating normally THEN the system SHALL emit structured logs with correlation IDs
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed traces of mode switches and healing attempts
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for latency, throughput, and error rates
4. IF problems occur THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic endpoints and health check APIs
5. WHEN investigating failures THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails of all decisions and actions
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide visual dashboards and alerting integration

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the hysteresis service to scale efficiently and maintain low overhead, so that it can support high-throughput event streams without becoming a bottleneck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-10ms latency for event routing
2. WHEN scaling load THEN the system SHALL handle 10,000+ events per second per tenant
3. WHEN using resources THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and prevent memory leaks
4. IF load spikes occur THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure and load shedding
5. WHEN distributing work THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling across multiple instances
6. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance metrics and profiling data
