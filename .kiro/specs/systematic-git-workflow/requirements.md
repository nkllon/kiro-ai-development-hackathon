# Systematic Git Workflow Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a systematic Git workflow that provides snapshot capabilities, feature branch management, and systematic development practices for the Beast Mode framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Snapshot Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create systematic snapshots of my work, so that I can safely experiment and rollback changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a snapshot THEN the system SHALL preserve the current state with a descriptive name
2. WHEN I list snapshots THEN the system SHALL show all available snapshots with timestamps and descriptions
3. WHEN I restore a snapshot THEN the system SHALL safely restore the specified state
4. WHEN I delete a snapshot THEN the system SHALL remove the snapshot after confirmation

### Requirement 2: Feature Branch Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want systematic feature branch management, so that I can work on features in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a new feature THEN the system SHALL create a properly named feature branch
2. WHEN I finish a feature THEN the system SHALL provide merge options with proper validation
3. WHEN I switch features THEN the system SHALL safely stash and restore work
4. WHEN I list features THEN the system SHALL show all feature branches with status

### Requirement 3: Systematic Commit Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want systematic commit practices, so that my commit history is clean and traceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I commit changes THEN the system SHALL enforce commit message standards
2. WHEN I stage changes THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent staging options
3. WHEN I review changes THEN the system SHALL show clear diffs and impact analysis
4. WHEN I amend commits THEN the system SHALL preserve commit integrity

### Requirement 4: Integration with Beast Mode

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode developer, I want Git workflow integration, so that my development follows systematic principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create branches THEN the system SHALL follow Beast Mode naming conventions
2. WHEN I commit THEN the system SHALL validate against spec requirements
3. WHEN I merge THEN the system SHALL run systematic quality checks
4. WHEN I push THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with project standards
