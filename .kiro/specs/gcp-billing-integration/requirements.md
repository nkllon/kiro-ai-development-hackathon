## Asset Bridge Strategy

### Systematic Code Reuse Approach
1. **Identify Assets**: Locate GCP billing modules in OpenFlow-Playground
2. **Extract Core Logic**: Pull out reusable billing API components
3. **Adapt Interfaces**: Wrap in Beast Mode-compatible interfaces
4. **Maintain Attribution**: Document source and maintain license compliance
5. **Test Integration**: Ensure functionality works in Beast Mode context

### Integration Points
- `scripts/beast_mode_resource_monitor.py` - Main integration point
- New module: `src/beast_mode/billing/gcp_integration.py`
- Configuration: Extend existing monitor config with GCP settings
- Dashboard: Add GCP metrics to existing display logic

## Notes

This integration leverages the systematic asset reuse principle - we're not reinventing GCP billing integration, we're systematically incorporating proven solutions into Beast Mode's comprehensive monitoring framework.

The key insight is that OpenFlow-Playground has already solved the hard problems (GCP API integration, authentication, data parsing) - we just need to bridge that solution into Beast Mode's systematic monitoring approach.
