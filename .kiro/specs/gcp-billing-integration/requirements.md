# GCP Billing Integration Requirements

## Overview
Integrate existing OpenFlow-Playground GCP billing analysis capabilities into Beast Mode resource monitoring system for comprehensive cost tracking and real-time financial governance.

## User Stories

### US-1: Asset Bridge Integration
**As a** Beast Mode developer  
**I want to** leverage existing GCP billing API code from OpenFlow-Playground  
**So that** I don't reinvent working solutions and can focus on Beast Mode integration  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Identify and extract GCP billing analysis modules from OpenFlow-Playground
- [ ] Create asset bridge pattern for systematic code reuse
- [ ] Maintain original functionality while adapting to Beast Mode interfaces
- [ ] Document provenance and attribution for reused components

### US-2: Real-Time GCP Cost Monitoring
**As a** developer using Beast Mode  
**I want to** see real-time GCP costs alongside LLM token costs  
**So that** I have complete financial visibility across all cloud resources  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Integrate GCP Billing API calls into existing resource monitor
- [ ] Display GCP costs in the Beast Mode dashboard
- [ ] Track GCP cost trends and burn rates
- [ ] Alert on GCP budget thresholds
- [ ] Correlate GCP costs with development activities

### US-3: Unified Financial Dashboard
**As a** project manager  
**I want to** see combined costs from LLMs, GCP services, and development resources  
**So that** I can make informed decisions about resource allocation  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Combine GCP billing data with existing token usage costs
- [ ] Show cost breakdown by service type (Compute, Storage, AI/ML, etc.)
- [ ] Display cost attribution by project/team
- [ ] Export unified cost reports
- [ ] Set budget alerts across all cost categories

### US-4: Development Activity Correlation
**As a** Beast Mode user  
**I want to** correlate GCP resource usage with development activities  
**So that** I can optimize costs and identify expensive operations  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tag GCP resources with development context (branch, feature, etc.)
- [ ] Track cost per development cycle/sprint
- [ ] Identify cost spikes during specific development phases
- [ ] Recommend cost optimization opportunities
- [ ] Generate cost-per-feature reports

### US-5: Mathematical Cost Correlation (Cloud Run Pay-Per-Transaction)
**As a** developer using Cloud Run serverless functions  
**I want to** understand exact mathematical correlation between transaction count and costs  
**So that** I can predict and optimize costs based on usage patterns  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement transaction-correlated cost model: requests × $0.000024
- [ ] Track CPU-correlated costs: CPU_seconds × $0.000009  
- [ ] Monitor memory-correlated costs: GB_seconds × $0.0000025
- [ ] Calculate network-proportional costs: data_transfer_GB × $0.12
- [ ] Separate fixed costs (storage, registry) from variable costs
- [ ] Display cost-per-request and cost-per-CPU-second metrics
- [ ] Provide real-time correlation analysis and efficiency insights
- [ ] Alert on optimization opportunities (high CPU usage, cold starts)

### US-6: Real-Time Cost Streaming
**As a** developer actively coding  
**I want to** see streaming cost updates during development  
**So that** I have immediate cost awareness while building features  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Stream cost updates every 2 seconds during active development
- [ ] Show real-time transaction count and associated costs
- [ ] Display live burn rate calculations based on current activity
- [ ] Provide streaming budget utilization updates
- [ ] Enable cost-aware development with immediate feedback
- [ ] Support callback functions for custom cost streaming integrations

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: GCP API Integration
- Reuse existing GCP Billing API authentication and query logic
- Implement rate limiting and error handling for API calls
- Cache billing data to minimize API costs
- Support multiple GCP projects and billing accounts

### TR-2: Beast Mode Interface Compliance
- Extend existing `BeastModeResourceMonitor` class
- Follow Reflective Module (RM) pattern for health monitoring
- Implement systematic error handling and recovery
- Maintain existing logging and metrics patterns

### TR-3: Real-Time Performance
- Update GCP billing data every 5-15 minutes (API rate limits)
- Cache recent data for dashboard responsiveness
- Implement incremental updates to minimize data transfer
- Handle GCP API latency gracefully

### TR-4: Data Integration
- Merge GCP costs with existing financial metrics
- Maintain separate cost tracking by source (LLM vs GCP vs other)
- Support cost allocation and chargeback scenarios
- Export data in standard formats (JSON, CSV)

## Asset Bridge Strategy

### Systematic Code Reuse Approach
1. **Identify Assets**: Locate GCP billing modules in OpenFlow-Playground
2. **Extract Core Logic**: Pull out reusable billing API components
3. **Adapt Interfaces**: Wrap in Beast Mode-compatible interfaces
4. **Maintain Attribution**: Document source and maintain license compliance
5. **Test Integration**: Ensure functionality works in Beast Mode context

### Integration Points
- `scripts/beast_mode_resource_monitor.py` - Main integration point
- New module: `src/beast_mode/billing/gcp_integration.py`
- Configuration: Extend existing monitor config with GCP settings
- Dashboard: Add GCP metrics to existing display logic

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- [ ] GCP billing data appears in Beast Mode dashboard within 24 hours
- [ ] Cost tracking accuracy matches GCP console (within 5%)
- [ ] Dashboard updates every 5-15 minutes without performance impact
- [ ] Alert system triggers on GCP budget thresholds

### Integration Success
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing Beast Mode functionality
- [ ] Reused code maintains original functionality
- [ ] New GCP features integrate seamlessly with existing UI
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains asset reuse approach

### Performance Success
- [ ] Dashboard response time remains under 2 seconds
- [ ] GCP API calls stay within rate limits
- [ ] Memory usage increase less than 50MB
- [ ] No impact on existing monitoring performance

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Asset Extraction (Day 1)
- Locate and extract GCP billing code from OpenFlow-Playground
- Create asset bridge module structure
- Test extracted code in isolation

### Phase 2: Beast Mode Integration (Day 2)
- Integrate GCP billing into resource monitor
- Extend dashboard with GCP metrics
- Implement configuration and authentication

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Day 3+)
- Add cost correlation with development activities
- Implement advanced alerting and reporting
- Optimize performance and add caching

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GCP API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and intelligent polling
- **Authentication Complexity**: Reuse existing auth patterns from OpenFlow
- **Data Volume**: Implement data retention and archival policies
- **Integration Conflicts**: Maintain strict interface boundaries

### Timeline Risks
- **Asset Location**: Have fallback plan to implement minimal GCP integration
- **API Changes**: Test with current GCP Billing API version
- **Complexity Creep**: Focus on MVP integration first, enhance later

## Definition of Done

### Minimum Viable Integration
- [ ] GCP billing data displays in Beast Mode dashboard
- [ ] Basic cost tracking and alerting works
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Code is documented and tested

### Complete Integration
- [ ] Full cost correlation with development activities
- [ ] Advanced reporting and export capabilities
- [ ] Optimized performance and caching
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Notes

This integration leverages the systematic asset reuse principle - we're not reinventing GCP billing integration, we're systematically incorporating proven solutions into Beast Mode's comprehensive monitoring framework.

The key insight is that OpenFlow-Playground has already solved the hard problems (GCP API integration, authentication, data parsing) - we just need to bridge that solution into Beast Mode's systematic monitoring approach.
