# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automated integration with Devpost to keep hackathon projects synchronized and up-to-date. The system will provide seamless project management capabilities, allowing developers to maintain their hackathon submissions directly from their development environment while ensuring all project information, updates, and deliverables are properly reflected on the Devpost platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to connect my local project to a Devpost submission, so that I can manage my hackathon entry from my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates Devpost connection THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Devpost API using OAuth or API key
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL retrieve the user's hackathon projects from Devpost
3. WHEN a user selects a hackathon project THEN the system SHALL establish a local mapping between the project directory and Devpost submission
4. IF no existing submission exists THEN the system SHALL provide option to create a new Devpost submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want my project updates to automatically sync with Devpost, so that my submission stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project files are modified THEN the system SHALL detect changes in key project files (README, documentation, source code)
2. WHEN significant changes are detected THEN the system SHALL update the project description on Devpost
3. WHEN a new release or tag is created THEN the system SHALL update the project version and changelog on Devpost
4. WHEN media files (screenshots, videos, demos) are added THEN the system SHALL upload them to the Devpost submission
5. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to manage my project's Devpost metadata from my IDE, so that I can maintain consistent project information without switching contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests metadata editing THEN the system SHALL display current Devpost project information (title, tagline, description, tags, team members)
2. WHEN metadata is modified locally THEN the system SHALL validate required fields according to Devpost requirements
3. WHEN metadata changes are saved THEN the system SHALL sync updates to Devpost immediately
4. WHEN team members are added or removed THEN the system SHALL update team composition on Devpost
5. IF metadata validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and prevent sync

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to track my submission status and deadlines, so that I can ensure timely completion of all requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to a hackathon THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display submission deadlines
2. WHEN approaching deadlines THEN the system SHALL provide notifications and reminders
3. WHEN submission requirements change THEN the system SHALL alert the user to required updates
4. WHEN the project is submitted THEN the system SHALL confirm successful submission and display status
5. IF submission is incomplete THEN the system SHALL highlight missing requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to preview how my project will appear on Devpost, so that I can ensure proper presentation before final submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests preview THEN the system SHALL generate a local preview matching Devpost's display format
2. WHEN preview is generated THEN the system SHALL include all current project data (description, images, links, team info)
3. WHEN preview is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight any formatting issues or missing required fields
4. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
5. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate what needs to be completed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to manage multiple hackathon projects simultaneously, so that I can participate in multiple events efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple projects are configured THEN the system SHALL maintain separate configurations for each hackathon
2. WHEN switching between projects THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate Devpost connection and settings
3. WHEN updates occur THEN the system SHALL sync only the active project to prevent cross-contamination
4. WHEN listing projects THEN the system SHALL display hackathon name, deadline, and submission status for each
5. IF project conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options
