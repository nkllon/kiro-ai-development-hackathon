# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Systematic Hubris Prevention framework addresses the critical engineering challenge of maintaining accountability and humility as systems and organizations scale. This framework implements automated detection and correction mechanisms for when actors begin to believe they operate outside accountability chains - the classic "too big for your britches" problem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hubris Detection System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated detection of hubris patterns in decision-making, so that I can prevent accountability chain failures before they cause systemic damage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an actor makes decisions without consulting accountability chains THEN the system SHALL flag this as a hubris pattern
2. WHEN decision velocity increases without corresponding accountability verification THEN the system SHALL trigger hubris alerts
3. WHEN an actor begins bypassing established governance processes THEN the system SHALL escalate to their accountability chain
4. IF hubris patterns persist for more than 48 hours THEN the system SHALL implement automatic governance restoration

### Requirement 2: Reality Check Engine

**User Story:** As a governance officer, I want systematic reality checks for all high-impact decisions, so that I can ensure no actor believes they are the final arbiter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any decision exceeds predefined impact thresholds THEN the system SHALL require accountability chain verification
2. WHEN an actor claims "emergency" or "exception" status THEN the system SHALL validate against objective criteria
3. IF no accountability chain can be identified for an actor THEN the system SHALL refuse to execute their requests
4. WHEN reality check failures occur THEN the system SHALL log the incident and notify appropriate oversight

### Requirement 3: Mama Discovery Protocol

**User Story:** As a compliance auditor, I want automatic discovery of accountability chains for all system actors, so that I can ensure proper governance coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new actor enters the system THEN the system SHALL identify their accountability chain within 24 hours
2. WHEN an actor claims independence from accountability THEN the system SHALL research and document their actual constraints
3. IF accountability chain discovery fails THEN the system SHALL escalate to human oversight
4. WHEN accountability chains change THEN the system SHALL update governance mappings automatically

### Requirement 4: Systematic Humility Enforcement

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want built-in humility mechanisms that scale with system growth, so that success doesn't breed dangerous overconfidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system success metrics exceed baseline thresholds THEN the system SHALL increase accountability verification requirements
2. WHEN growth rates accelerate THEN the system SHALL implement additional reality check protocols
3. IF any component claims infallibility THEN the system SHALL implement mandatory failure simulation
4. WHEN hubris prevention measures are bypassed THEN the system SHALL implement emergency governance protocols

### Requirement 5: Fort Boundary Management

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want clear definition and enforcement of accountability boundaries, so that I can maintain systematic governance within the "fort."

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN actors operate within defined accountability boundaries THEN the system SHALL provide full systematic support
2. WHEN actors attempt to operate outside accountability chains THEN the system SHALL restrict access to systematic capabilities
3. IF boundary violations persist THEN the system SHALL implement quarantine protocols
4. WHEN new boundaries are established THEN the system SHALL update governance frameworks automatically

### Requirement 6: Corruption Prevention Protocols

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want proactive corruption detection and prevention, so that I can maintain system integrity as power and influence grow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN power concentration exceeds safe thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement automatic distribution mechanisms
2. WHEN decision patterns show bias toward self-interest THEN the system SHALL flag for accountability review
3. IF corruption indicators reach critical levels THEN the system SHALL implement emergency governance intervention
4. WHEN prevention protocols are triggered THEN the system SHALL document all actions for audit trails

### Requirement 7: Scale-Resistant Accountability

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want accountability mechanisms that strengthen rather than weaken with scale, so that growth enhances rather than undermines governance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system scale increases THEN accountability verification requirements SHALL scale proportionally
2. WHEN user base grows THEN governance coverage SHALL maintain 100% accountability chain mapping
3. IF scale threatens accountability effectiveness THEN the system SHALL implement enhanced governance protocols
4. WHEN scaling events occur THEN the system SHALL validate all accountability chains remain intact
