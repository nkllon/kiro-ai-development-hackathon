# Multi-Instance Kiro Orchestration System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a Multi-Instance Kiro Orchestration System that enables launching multiple Kiro IDE instances on different branches to execute parallel task sets. The system coordinates autonomous Kiro agents working simultaneously on independent tasks, dramatically reducing development time while maintaining systematic quality and integration.

The system uses git worktree for efficient workspace isolation, avoiding full repository clones while providing complete branch isolation. Communication uses text-based structured actions, making all inter-instance coordination instantly debuggable and extensible through natural language commands like 'run task abc beast mode', 'stop all running threads', or 'git sync'.

This system implements Beast Mode Framework principles with systematic PDCA methodology, ensuring all components inherit from ReflectiveModule pattern and maintain >90% test coverage (DR8 compliance). The architecture follows Python 3.9+ technology stack with systematic tool orchestration and model-driven decision making.
