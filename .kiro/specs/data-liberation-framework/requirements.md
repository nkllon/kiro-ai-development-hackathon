# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a systematic data liberation framework that gives users complete control over their data trapped in proprietary platforms. The system addresses the fundamental injustice where tech giants capture user-generated content, relationships, and data, then lock it behind restrictive APIs while monetizing it for their own benefit. The framework implements "Give me a fucking API" automation to systematically extract, liberate, and provide open access to user's own data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Universal Data Extraction

**User Story:** As a user whose data is trapped in proprietary platforms, I want systematic data extraction tools, so that I can reclaim ownership and control of my own information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want my LinkedIn data THEN the system SHALL extract my complete professional network, posts, connections, and activity history
2. WHEN I want my Meta data THEN the system SHALL extract my social graph, posts, photos, messages, and interaction history  
3. WHEN I want my Google data THEN the system SHALL extract my emails, documents, search history, and service data
4. WHEN I want my Twitter/X data THEN the system SHALL extract my followers, tweets, DMs, and engagement data
5. WHEN platforms restrict access THEN the system SHALL use systematic workarounds and automation to bypass artificial limitations

### Requirement 2: Portable Identity System

**User Story:** As a user who wants data sovereignty, I want a portable identity system, so that I can own my digital identity independent of any single platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating my portable identity THEN the system SHALL generate a unified profile combining data from all platforms
2. WHEN platforms change their policies THEN my portable identity SHALL remain intact and accessible
3. WHEN I want to switch platforms THEN the system SHALL enable seamless migration of my complete digital identity
4. WHEN I want to control access THEN the system SHALL provide granular permissions for who can access what data
5. WHEN platforms try to lock me in THEN my portable identity SHALL provide complete independence

### Requirement 3: Open API Generation

**User Story:** As a user who owns my data, I want open APIs for my own information, so that I can integrate my data with any tools or services I choose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I liberate my data THEN the system SHALL automatically generate RESTful APIs for all my information
2. WHEN I want to share specific data THEN the system SHALL provide granular API endpoints with proper authentication
3. WHEN developers want to build tools THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation and SDKs
4. WHEN I update my data THEN the APIs SHALL reflect changes in real-time with proper versioning
5. WHEN I want to revoke access THEN the system SHALL provide immediate API key management and access control

### Requirement 4: Relationship Graph Liberation

**User Story:** As a user with valuable professional and social networks, I want to liberate my relationship graphs, so that I can maintain my connections independent of any platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting my network THEN the system SHALL map all connections, interaction patterns, and relationship strengths
2. WHEN contacts change platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain connection continuity across platform migrations
3. WHEN I want to analyze my network THEN the system SHALL provide relationship analytics and insights
4. WHEN building new connections THEN the system SHALL suggest introductions based on my liberated network data
5. WHEN platforms try to fragment my network THEN the system SHALL maintain unified relationship management

### Requirement 5: Anti-Monopoly Automation

**User Story:** As a user fighting against tech giant monopolies, I want systematic tools that break platform lock-in, so that I can maintain my digital freedom.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN platforms implement new restrictions THEN the system SHALL automatically develop workarounds within 48 hours
2. WHEN APIs are artificially limited THEN the system SHALL use alternative extraction methods (scraping, automation, reverse engineering)
3. WHEN platforms change terms of service THEN the system SHALL alert me and provide migration options
4. WHEN new platforms emerge THEN the system SHALL quickly integrate them into the liberation framework
5. WHEN platforms try to prevent data export THEN the system SHALL use systematic approaches to maintain user data sovereignty

### Requirement 6: Data Sovereignty Dashboard

**User Story:** As a user who wants complete control over my digital life, I want a comprehensive dashboard, so that I can monitor, manage, and control all my liberated data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my dashboard THEN I SHALL see all my data across all platforms in unified interface
2. WHEN managing permissions THEN I SHALL control exactly who has access to what data with granular controls
3. WHEN monitoring usage THEN I SHALL see how my data is being accessed and by whom
4. WHEN detecting unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL alert me and provide immediate lockdown capabilities
5. WHEN wanting insights THEN I SHALL get analytics about my digital footprint and data usage patterns

### Requirement 7: Legal Compliance & Rights Enforcement

**User Story:** As a user with legal rights to my data, I want systematic enforcement tools, so that I can compel platforms to provide proper access to my information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN platforms violate data portability rights THEN the system SHALL generate legal compliance demands automatically
2. WHEN GDPR/CCPA rights are ignored THEN the system SHALL escalate to regulatory authorities with systematic documentation
3. WHEN platforms provide incomplete data THEN the system SHALL identify gaps and demand complete information
4. WHEN legal action is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive evidence packages for attorneys
5. WHEN platforms comply THEN the system SHALL validate completeness and accuracy of provided data

### Requirement 8: Community Data Liberation

**User Story:** As part of a community fighting for data rights, I want collaborative liberation tools, so that we can systematically free everyone's data together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users target the same platform THEN the system SHALL coordinate extraction efforts for maximum efficiency
2. WHEN new extraction methods are developed THEN the system SHALL share techniques across the community
3. WHEN platforms implement countermeasures THEN the community SHALL collaborate on systematic workarounds
4. WHEN legal challenges arise THEN the system SHALL coordinate community legal action and resource sharing
5. WHEN victories are achieved THEN the system SHALL document and replicate successful liberation strategies
