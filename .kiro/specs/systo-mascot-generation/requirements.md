# Systo Mascot LLM Generation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the systematic generation of Systo mascot visuals using LLM-powered image generation tools. The approach transforms our detailed mascot requirements into precise visual prompts that can be executed by various AI image generation models (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.) to create consistent, on-brand mascot imagery.

**ðŸŽ¯ Core Philosophy: "The Requirements ARE the Visual Solution"**

Our mascot specification becomes the systematic input for LLM visual generation, ensuring consistent brand representation across all generated imagery while maintaining the flexibility to create variations for different use cases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want to generate consistent Systo mascot images from our specification, so that all visual representations maintain brand coherence across different contexts and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating base Systo imagery THEN the system SHALL use systematic prompts derived from the mascot specification
2. WHEN creating variations THEN the system SHALL maintain core visual identity while adapting for specific contexts
3. WHEN using different LLM image generators THEN the system SHALL provide model-specific prompt optimizations
4. WHEN generating multiple images THEN the system SHALL ensure visual consistency across the set
5. WHEN creating new contexts THEN the system SHALL systematically adapt the base specification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a marketing team member, I want to generate Systo variations for different DevOps contexts, so that our mascot can represent various technical scenarios while maintaining brand recognition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating SRE Systo THEN the system SHALL include "This is Fine" shirt and calm demeanor while fixing burning servers
2. WHEN generating Platform Systo THEN the system SHALL include hard hat and Infrastructure as Code blueprints
3. WHEN generating Security Systo THEN the system SHALL include Zero Trust bandana and vulnerability magnifying glass
4. WHEN generating Cloud Native Systo THEN the system SHALL include Kubernetes patterns and floating cloud symbols
5. WHEN creating new variations THEN the system SHALL follow systematic adaptation patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to generate Systo images optimized for different LLM image generation models, so that I can achieve the best results regardless of which AI tool I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using DALL-E THEN the system SHALL provide prompts optimized for OpenAI's style preferences and limitations
2. WHEN using Midjourney THEN the system SHALL include appropriate style parameters and aspect ratio specifications
3. WHEN using Stable Diffusion THEN the system SHALL provide detailed prompts with negative prompt specifications
4. WHEN using other models THEN the system SHALL provide adaptable base prompts with model-specific guidance
5. WHEN comparing outputs THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency across different generation models

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to programmatically generate Systo mascot images through API calls, so that I can integrate mascot generation into automated workflows and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the generation API THEN the system SHALL accept context parameters and return appropriate prompts
2. WHEN integrating with image generation services THEN the system SHALL handle API authentication and rate limiting
3. WHEN generating batch images THEN the system SHALL manage concurrent requests and result aggregation
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide systematic fallback prompts and error handling
5. WHEN caching results THEN the system SHALL store generated images with metadata for reuse

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance specialist, I want to validate generated Systo images against brand guidelines, so that all mascot imagery meets our systematic standards before publication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating generated images THEN the system SHALL check for core visual elements (wolf-dog hybrid, athletic build, collaborative posture)
2. WHEN reviewing expressions THEN the system SHALL verify focused demeanor with slight confidence smirk
3. WHEN checking brand consistency THEN the system SHALL validate color schemes, proportions, and style adherence
4. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback for prompt refinement
5. WHEN approving images THEN the system SHALL tag them with quality scores and usage recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a community manager, I want to generate Systo mascot content for different platforms and formats, so that our brand presence is consistent across social media, documentation, and swag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating social media content THEN the system SHALL create platform-appropriate aspect ratios and resolutions
2. WHEN creating documentation imagery THEN the system SHALL generate clean, professional variations suitable for technical content
3. WHEN designing swag concepts THEN the system SHALL create simplified, high-contrast versions suitable for printing
4. WHEN producing animated concepts THEN the system SHALL generate keyframe sequences for motion graphics
5. WHEN adapting for accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast and clear visual elements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a systematic developer, I want to iterate and improve mascot generation prompts based on results, so that our visual generation becomes more accurate and efficient over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing generation results THEN the system SHALL collect feedback on prompt effectiveness and image quality
2. WHEN identifying patterns THEN the system SHALL learn which prompt elements produce the best results for each model
3. WHEN refining prompts THEN the system SHALL systematically test variations and measure improvement
4. WHEN updating specifications THEN the system SHALL version control prompt changes and track performance metrics
5. WHEN sharing learnings THEN the system SHALL document best practices for systematic visual generation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a brand strategist, I want to maintain Systo's "glue between humans and AI" positioning in all generated imagery, so that our mascot visually represents our core philosophy of human-AI collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating collaborative scenes THEN the system SHALL show Systo bridging or connecting human and AI elements
2. WHEN depicting problem-solving THEN the system SHALL show Systo as enabler rather than replacement for human creativity
3. WHEN creating team imagery THEN the system SHALL position Systo as supportive teammate rather than leader or follower
4. WHEN showing technical contexts THEN the system SHALL balance systematic capability with approachable personality
5. WHEN representing the brand THEN the system SHALL visually communicate "competent teammate with emotional intelligence"
