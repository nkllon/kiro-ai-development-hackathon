# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a multi-language systematic improvement ecosystem for HashiCorp Packer, including both Go-based core improvements and Python wrapper enhancements. The toolkit applies Beast Mode Framework principles to enhance Packer's user experience and developer experience through systematic analysis, improved diagnostics, and intelligent automation. The approach includes: (1) Go-based improvements for core Packer functionality and potential upstream contributions, (2) Python-based systematic wrappers and tooling distributed via PyPI, and (3) systematic improvements to existing Python Packer libraries in the ecosystem. The goal is to make Packer easier to understand, leverage, and use across all language ecosystems while maintaining its powerful build automation capabilities.
