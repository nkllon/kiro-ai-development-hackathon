# GKE Cluster Management Requirements

## Introduction

The GKE Cluster Management specification provides systematic Kubernetes cluster provisioning, configuration, and lifecycle management on Google Cloud Platform. This component serves as the foundational infrastructure layer that enables systematic deployment of containerized applications with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability.

**Single Responsibility:** Provision and manage GKE clusters with systematic configuration, security, and operational excellence.

## Dependency Architecture

**Foundation Dependencies:** This specification has no dependencies - it provides foundational infrastructure.

**Dependency Relationship:**

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Cluster Provisioning

**User Story:** As an infrastructure operator, I want to provision GKE clusters with systematic configuration, so that I can provide reliable Kubernetes infrastructure for applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provision a cluster THEN it SHALL be created with systematic security and operational configurations
2. WHEN cluster is created THEN it SHALL include auto-scaling, auto-repair, and auto-upgrade capabilities
3. WHEN cluster is provisioned THEN it SHALL implement network policies and Workload Identity for security
4. WHEN cluster is ready THEN it SHALL provide high availability across multiple zones
5. WHEN cluster is created THEN it SHALL include monitoring and logging integration

### Requirement 2: Infrastructure as Code Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage cluster configuration through code, so that I can ensure consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing clusters THEN I SHALL use Terraform for infrastructure as code
2. WHEN cluster configuration changes THEN changes SHALL be version controlled and reviewable
3. WHEN deploying clusters THEN configuration SHALL be parameterized for different environments
4. WHEN cluster is updated THEN changes SHALL be applied systematically with rollback capability
5. WHEN cluster is destroyed THEN cleanup SHALL be complete with no orphaned resources

### Requirement 3: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want clusters to implement systematic security controls, so that I can ensure enterprise-grade security posture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster is created THEN it SHALL implement Workload Identity for secure GCP service integration
2. WHEN network policies are configured THEN they SHALL provide systematic pod-to-pod traffic control
3. WHEN cluster access is configured THEN it SHALL use RBAC with least-privilege principles
4. WHEN cluster is operational THEN it SHALL provide audit logging for all API server activities
5. WHEN security updates are available THEN they SHALL be applied systematically through auto-upgrade

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### DR1: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster is provisioned THEN it SHALL provide 99.9% uptime SLA through regional deployment
2. WHEN nodes fail THEN auto-repair SHALL restore cluster capacity within 10 minutes
3. WHEN cluster is under load THEN auto-scaling SHALL maintain performance within SLA targets
4. WHEN Kubernetes versions are updated THEN auto-upgrade SHALL maintain service availability
5. WHEN cluster experiences issues THEN monitoring SHALL provide systematic alerting and diagnostics

### DR2: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster is provisioned THEN it SHALL support up to 1000 pods per node efficiently
2. WHEN applications are deployed THEN cluster SHALL provide sub-second pod startup times
3. WHEN cluster scales THEN new nodes SHALL be available within 5 minutes
4. WHEN network traffic flows THEN cluster SHALL provide low-latency pod-to-pod communication
5. WHEN cluster is monitored THEN metrics SHALL be collected with minimal performance impact

### DR3: Cost Optimization Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cluster is idle THEN it SHALL scale down to minimum viable configuration
2. WHEN workloads are scheduled THEN cluster SHALL optimize node utilization above 70%
3. WHEN cluster resources are allocated THEN it SHALL use cost-effective machine types
4. WHEN cluster is monitored THEN cost tracking SHALL provide systematic spend visibility
5. WHEN cluster is no longer needed THEN it SHALL be cleanly destroyed to prevent ongoing costs
