# Systematic PDCA Orchestrator Requirements

## Introduction

The Systematic PDCA Orchestrator provides the core Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle execution engine for systematic development workflows. This component serves as the foundational orchestration layer that transforms ad-hoc development approaches into systematic, measurable processes. It focuses exclusively on PDCA cycle execution, model-driven planning, and systematic validation.

**Single Responsibility:** Execute and orchestrate PDCA cycles with systematic validation and model-driven decision making.

## Dependency Architecture

**Foundation Dependency:** This specification depends on the Ghostbusters Framework for multi-agent orchestration and validation services.

**Dependency Relationship:**
```
Ghostbusters Framework (Foundation)

Systematic PDCA Orchestrator (This Spec)

[Beast Mode Core, Tool Health Manager, etc.] (Consumers)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: PDCA Cycle Execution

**User Story:** As a systematic development orchestrator, I want to execute complete PDCA cycles on real development tasks, so that I can prove systematic methodology works in practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a development task THEN I SHALL execute a complete Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle
2. WHEN planning THEN I SHALL use project model registry to identify requirements and constraints
3. WHEN doing THEN I SHALL implement with systematic approach, not ad-hoc coding
4. WHEN checking THEN I SHALL validate against model requirements and perform RCA on any failures
5. WHEN acting THEN I SHALL update the project model with successful patterns and lessons learned

### Requirement 2: Model-Driven Planning

**User Story:** As a PDCA orchestrator, I want to make model-driven planning decisions using project registry intelligence, so that I can eliminate guesswork from the planning phase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making planning decisions THEN I SHALL consult project_model_registry.json with its 69 requirements first
2. WHEN the project registry contains relevant domain information THEN I SHALL use domain-specific requirements and tool mappings from 100 domains
3. WHEN the project registry lacks information THEN I SHALL gather intelligence systematically, not guess
4. WHEN planning decisions are made THEN I SHALL document the model-based reasoning with RCA analysis
5. WHEN successful patterns emerge THEN I SHALL update the project registry with new intelligence

### Requirement 3: Systematic Validation and Learning

**User Story:** As a PDCA orchestrator, I want to perform systematic validation and learning from each cycle, so that I can continuously improve systematic approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation occurs THEN I SHALL use Ghostbusters validation framework for systematic quality checks
2. WHEN failures are detected THEN I SHALL perform systematic RCA to identify root causes
3. WHEN cycles complete THEN I SHALL extract learning patterns and update the model registry
4. WHEN validation confidence is low THEN I SHALL escalate to Ghostbusters multi-agent consensus
5. WHEN learning accumulates THEN I SHALL demonstrate measurable improvement in subsequent cycles

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### DR1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing PDCA cycles THEN each cycle SHALL complete within 2x the time of ad-hoc approaches but with 90%+ success rate vs 60% for ad-hoc
2. WHEN consulting project registry THEN model queries SHALL return results within 100ms for 95% of requests
3. WHEN performing validation THEN systematic checks SHALL complete within 30 seconds for standard tasks
4. WHEN updating model registry THEN changes SHALL be persisted within 1 second
5. WHEN scaling THEN system SHALL handle 10+ concurrent PDCA cycles without performance degradation

### DR2: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any validation step fails THEN system SHALL continue with degraded systematic approach rather than complete failure
2. WHEN model registry is unavailable THEN system SHALL use cached intelligence with appropriate confidence reduction
3. WHEN Ghostbusters services are degraded THEN system SHALL fall back to basic systematic validation
4. WHEN cycles are interrupted THEN system SHALL resume from last valid checkpoint
5. WHEN under load THEN system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for critical PDCA orchestration services
