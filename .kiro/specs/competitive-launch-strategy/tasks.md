# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan orchestrates a systematic competitive launch across GKE, TiDB, and Kiro platforms to beat Meta to market. The plan follows von Moltke's principle: "No plan survives contact with the enemy, but planning is everything" - creating adaptive systems that can pivot under competitive pressure while maintaining systematic quality.
