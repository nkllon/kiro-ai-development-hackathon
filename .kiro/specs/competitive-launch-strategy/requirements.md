# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a systematic competitive launch strategy to beat Meta and other tech giants to market with our AI-powered systematic development framework. The strategy leverages our unique advantages (GKE, TiDB, Kiro) while acknowledging that "all plans fail on first contact with the enemy" but "all planning is vital." The system must deliver measurable competitive advantage through systematic superiority while maintaining rapid deployment velocity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Platform Deployment Orchestration

**User Story:** As a competitive startup, I want to deploy simultaneously across GKE, TiDB, and Kiro platforms, so that I can maximize market reach and minimize single-point-of-failure risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN I SHALL orchestrate deployment across GKE (cloud scale), TiDB (data persistence), and Kiro (AI integration) simultaneously
2. WHEN one platform fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating on remaining platforms with graceful degradation
3. WHEN platform-specific optimizations are needed THEN the system SHALL adapt deployment strategies per platform without breaking cross-platform compatibility
4. WHEN scaling decisions are required THEN the system SHALL leverage platform-specific strengths (GKE for compute, TiDB for data, Kiro for AI)
5. WHEN monitoring deployment health THEN the system SHALL provide unified visibility across all three platforms

### Requirement 2: Rapid Competitive Response System

**User Story:** As a startup racing against Meta, I want a systematic response system for competitive threats, so that I can adapt faster than large corporations while maintaining systematic quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN competitive intelligence is detected THEN the system SHALL trigger systematic analysis within 1 hour
2. WHEN Meta announces similar features THEN the system SHALL generate differentiation strategies within 24 hours
3. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL update deployment priorities and resource allocation automatically
4. WHEN competitive advantages are identified THEN the system SHALL accelerate development of those features through parallel execution
5. WHEN systematic superiority can be demonstrated THEN the system SHALL generate evidence packages for marketing and sales

### Requirement 3: Hackathon Deadline Management

**User Story:** As a team with a September 15 deadline, I want systematic deadline management that accounts for Murphy's Law, so that I can deliver on time despite inevitable setbacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hackathon deadline approaches THEN the system SHALL prioritize features by competitive impact and implementation complexity
2. WHEN tasks are behind schedule THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger parallel execution and resource reallocation
3. WHEN critical path tasks are identified THEN the system SHALL provide daily progress tracking and risk assessment
4. WHEN scope reduction is needed THEN the system SHALL recommend features to cut based on competitive value analysis
5. WHEN submission requirements are due THEN the system SHALL validate completeness and generate submission packages automatically

### Requirement 4: Systematic Superiority Demonstration

**User Story:** As a systematic development framework, I want to prove measurable superiority over ad-hoc approaches, so that I can win customers through evidence rather than marketing claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing to competitors THEN the system SHALL generate quantitative superiority metrics (speed, quality, reliability)
2. WHEN demonstrating value THEN the system SHALL provide concrete evidence of "Requirements ARE the Solution" methodology
3. WHEN showcasing capabilities THEN the system SHALL highlight unique advantages (FMH principles, accountability chains, systematic governance)
4. WHEN engaging prospects THEN the system SHALL generate customer-specific ROI calculations and risk reduction analysis
5. WHEN building credibility THEN the system SHALL maintain >90% test coverage and systematic quality gates

### Requirement 5: Adaptive Resource Allocation

**User Story:** As a resource-constrained startup, I want intelligent resource allocation that adapts to changing priorities, so that I can maximize impact with limited resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resource conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on competitive impact and deadline proximity
2. WHEN new opportunities arise THEN the system SHALL reallocate resources systematically without breaking existing commitments
3. WHEN team capacity changes THEN the system SHALL adjust parallel execution strategies and timeline estimates
4. WHEN technical debt accumulates THEN the system SHALL balance feature development with systematic quality maintenance
5. WHEN market feedback is received THEN the system SHALL incorporate insights into resource allocation decisions

### Requirement 6: Platform-Specific Optimization

**User Story:** As a multi-platform system, I want to leverage each platform's unique strengths, so that I can achieve maximum performance and competitive advantage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using GKE THEN the system SHALL optimize for horizontal scaling, auto-scaling, and cloud-native patterns
2. WHEN using TiDB THEN the system SHALL leverage distributed SQL capabilities, HTAP workloads, and real-time analytics
3. WHEN using Kiro THEN the system SHALL maximize AI-assisted development, spec-driven workflows, and systematic automation
4. WHEN integrating platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and operational coherence across all three
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL use platform-specific monitoring and optimization tools

### Requirement 7: Competitive Intelligence Integration

**User Story:** As a startup competing with tech giants, I want systematic competitive intelligence, so that I can make informed strategic decisions and identify market opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring competitors THEN the system SHALL track Meta, Google, Microsoft, and other relevant players automatically
2. WHEN competitive moves are detected THEN the system SHALL analyze impact on our positioning and recommend responses
3. WHEN market trends emerge THEN the system SHALL assess alignment with our systematic approach and competitive advantages
4. WHEN customer feedback mentions competitors THEN the system SHALL incorporate insights into product development priorities
5. WHEN differentiation opportunities arise THEN the system SHALL highlight unique value propositions and systematic superiority

### Requirement 8: Failure Recovery and Adaptation

**User Story:** As a team that knows "all plans fail on first contact," I want systematic failure recovery, so that I can adapt quickly while maintaining systematic quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plans fail THEN the system SHALL trigger systematic RCA and generate alternative approaches within 2 hours
2. WHEN unexpected obstacles arise THEN the system SHALL reallocate resources and adjust timelines systematically
3. WHEN technical challenges block progress THEN the system SHALL identify parallel paths and workaround strategies
4. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL update competitive strategy and deployment priorities
5. WHEN team capacity is reduced THEN the system SHALL maintain critical path progress through systematic prioritization
