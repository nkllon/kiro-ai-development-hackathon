# Headless Spec Execution Framework Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a **Headless Spec Execution Framework** that orchestrates background execution of entire spec task DAGs using the Parallel DAG Orchestrator. The system provides autonomous execution of complex multi-spec development workflows with comprehensive monitoring, progress tracking, and systematic quality assurance. The framework enables "fire-and-forget" execution of large-scale development initiatives while maintaining full visibility and control.

5. WHEN ensuring consistency THEN the system SHALL validate execution state integrity and detect/resolve inconsistencies

### Requirement 5: Quality Assurance Integration
**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want systematic quality validation throughout background execution, so that autonomous development maintains the same quality standards as manual development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing tasks THEN the system SHALL apply systematic quality gates and validation at each completion milestone

5. WHEN completing execution THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive quality reports and compliance validation

### Requirement 6: Resource Management and Scaling
**User Story:** As a resource manager, I want intelligent resource allocation and scaling for background execution, so that development can scale efficiently while managing costs and resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL dynamically allocate compute resources based on execution complexity and timeline requirements
2. WHEN scaling execution THEN the system SHALL leverage both local resources and GCP Cloud Run for optimal cost/performance balance

5. WHEN managing constraints THEN the system SHALL respect resource limits, budget constraints, and execution priorities

### Requirement 7: Notification and Alerting System
**User Story:** As a development team member, I want intelligent notifications about background execution progress and issues, so that I can stay informed without being overwhelmed by unnecessary alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing notifications THEN the system SHALL support multiple channels (email, Slack, webhook, dashboard)
2. WHEN determining alerts THEN the system SHALL use intelligent filtering to send only actionable and important notifications
3. WHEN tracking milestones THEN the system SHALL notify on spec completion, critical path delays, and quality gate failures
4. WHEN escalating issues THEN the system SHALL provide escalation paths for blocked execution and critical failures
5. WHEN summarizing progress THEN the system SHALL provide daily/weekly execution summaries with key metrics and achievements

### Requirement 8: Execution Control and Intervention
**User Story:** As a development lead, I want the ability to monitor and control background execution without disrupting autonomous operation, so that I can provide guidance and make adjustments when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing control THEN the system SHALL offer execution pause, resume, abort, and priority adjustment capabilities
2. WHEN enabling intervention THEN the system SHALL support task retry, dependency override, and execution path modification
3. WHEN managing priorities THEN the system SHALL allow dynamic priority adjustment and resource reallocation
4. WHEN providing guidance THEN the system SHALL support injection of additional context, constraints, or requirements
5. WHEN ensuring safety THEN the system SHALL validate all interventions for consistency and prevent execution corruption

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Systems
