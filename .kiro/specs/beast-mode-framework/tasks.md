# Beast Mode Framework DAG Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan structures the Beast Mode Framework as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks, enabling parallel execution while maintaining systematic dependencies. The DAG approach maximizes development velocity by identifying independent tasks that can run concurrently while ensuring proper dependency management.

## DAG Structure Principles

1. **Parallel Execution**: Tasks with no dependencies can run simultaneously
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Each task explicitly declares its prerequisites
3. **Atomic Tasks**: Each task is self-contained and testable
4. **Systematic Approach**: All tasks maintain Beast Mode systematic principles
5. **RM Compliance**: All components inherit from ReflectiveModule
