# Implementation Plan - Beast Mode Framework (DEPRECATED - RM VIOLATION)

## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE

**This implementation plan is for a monolithic architecture that violates RM principles.**

**Status:** DEPRECATED - Use RM-compliant implementation instead

**Replacement Plans:**
- **Overall Coordination:** `.kiro/specs/integrated-beast-mode-system/tasks.md`
- **PDCA Functionality:** `.kiro/specs/systematic-pdca-orchestrator/tasks.md`
- **Tool Health:** `.kiro/specs/tool-health-manager/tasks.md`
- **Metrics & Analytics:** `.kiro/specs/systematic-metrics-engine/tasks.md`
- **Parallel Execution:** `.kiro/specs/parallel-dag-orchestrator/tasks.md`
- **Integration Hub:** `.kiro/specs/beast-mode-core/tasks.md`

## Migration Strategy

**Instead of implementing this monolithic plan:**

1. **Use Integrated Beast Mode System** for overall coordination
2. **Implement specialized components** using their individual task plans
3. **Follow RM-compliant architecture** to ensure maintainable, testable components
4. **Leverage existing implementations** where they already exist

## Original Overview (Historical Reference)

This implementation plan converts the Beast Mode Framework design into a series of actionable coding tasks. Each task builds incrementally on previous tasks, following test-driven development principles and ensuring systematic superiority over ad-hoc approaches. The plan prioritizes fixing tools first, implementing PDCA cycles, and demonstrating measurable results.

**⚠️ This monolithic implementation approach violated RM principles and has been replaced by specialized component implementations.**
