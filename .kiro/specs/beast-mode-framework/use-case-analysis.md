## Detailed Analysis: UC-01 Self-Diagnostic Tool Health Validation

### Use Case Elaboration

**Primary Actor:** Beast Mode Framework (System Self)
**Goal:** Validate system credibility by successfully diagnosing and fixing its own broken Makefile
**Preconditions:** 
- Beast Mode Framework is operational
- Makefile exists but `make help` fails due to missing makefiles/ directory
- System has diagnostic and repair capabilities

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. Beast Mode detects Makefile execution failure (`make help` command fails)
2. System initiates systematic diagnostic process
3. Diagnoses root cause: missing makefiles/ directory structure
4. Implements systematic repair: creates proper modular Makefile structure
5. Validates repair: confirms `make help` and other targets work correctly
6. Documents prevention pattern for future similar failures
7. Measures and records systematic vs ad-hoc approach performance
8. Updates project model with successful repair pattern

**Alternative Scenarios:**
- **A1:** Diagnostic process identifies multiple root causes → prioritize and fix systematically
- **A2:** Repair attempt fails → perform deeper RCA and alternative systematic fix
- **A3:** Validation reveals incomplete fix → iterate repair process until fully functional

**Failure Scenarios:**
- **F1:** System cannot diagnose root cause → credibility failure, manual intervention required
- **F2:** Systematic repair fails repeatedly → methodology credibility undermined
- **F3:** Fixed Makefile breaks again → prevention pattern inadequate

   - Missing service consumer perspective validation

#### Recommended Task List Revisions:

**Priority 1: Immediate Credibility Establishment**
- **New Task 1:** Implement UC-01 Self-Diagnostic Tool Health Validation
  - Create MakefileHealthManager with systematic diagnosis

   - Re-rank use cases based on consolidated multi-stakeholder scores
   - Incorporate constraint impacts and unknown risk factors
   - Validate priority changes against original requirements

2. **Implementation Strategy Adjustment**
   - Revise task priorities based on updated risk assessment
   - Adjust implementation approach to address highest-risk items first
   - Document rationale for priority changes and implementation adjustments

3. **Stakeholder Validation Loop**
   - Present updated priorities to stakeholder representatives
   - Gather feedback on priority changes and risk assessments
   - Iterate until stakeholder consensus on priority and approach

### Process Metrics and Success Criteria

#### Quantitative Metrics
- **Risk Coverage:** Percentage of identified risks with mitigation strategies
- **Constraint Compliance:** Percentage of constraints with implementation plans
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Consensus score across stakeholder priorities
- **Unknown Resolution:** Percentage of unknowns converted to known risks or constraints

#### Qualitative Success Criteria
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All stakeholder perspectives represented in final priorities
- **Implementation Feasibility:** Top priorities have clear, actionable implementation paths
- **Risk Mitigation:** High-risk items have documented mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder Buy-in:** All stakeholders understand and accept final priorities

### Reuse Guidelines

#### When to Apply This Procedure
- Complex systems with multiple stakeholder types
- High-uncertainty projects with significant unknowns
- Systems with competing constraints and trade-offs
- Projects where stakeholder alignment is critical for success

#### Adaptation Considerations
- Adjust stakeholder categories based on project context
- Modify constraint categories based on technology stack and domain
- Scale scoring granularity based on project complexity
- Adapt validation loops based on stakeholder availability and decision-making processes

#### Success Factors for Reuse
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Ensure representative participation from all stakeholder categories
- **Iterative Refinement:** Plan for multiple tuning cycles as understanding improves
- **Documentation Discipline:** Maintain clear rationale for all priority and approach changes
- **Validation Rigor:** Ensure updated priorities still satisfy original requirements and constraints

This requirements tuning procedure provides a systematic approach for managing complexity, uncertainty, and stakeholder alignment in requirements-driven development, ensuring that implementation priorities reflect both technical constraints and stakeholder value delivery needs.
