# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Beast Mode Framework transforms the Kiro AI Development Hackathon from a regular hackathon into a systematic domination engine. Unlike regular hackathons that rely on chaos and guesswork, Beast Mode uses systematic PDCA cycles, fixes broken tools instead of working around them, and makes model-driven decisions using the project registry's 165 requirements and 100 domains. The framework must provide concrete, measurable superiority over ad-hoc approaches and power other hackathons (GKE) through systematic services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode hackathon, I want to demonstrate systematic superiority over regular hackathons, so that I can prove Beast Mode methodology works through concrete, measurable results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my own Makefile is executed THEN it SHALL work without errors (proving I can fix my own tools)
2. WHEN I encounter a broken tool THEN I SHALL fix it systematically rather than work around it
3. WHEN I make development decisions THEN I SHALL use project model registry data, not guesswork
4. WHEN GKE hackathon requests services THEN I SHALL provide working Beast Mode capabilities
5. WHEN measuring my performance THEN I SHALL demonstrate measurable superiority over ad-hoc approaches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to execute actual PDCA cycles on real development tasks, so that I can prove systematic methodology works in practice, not just theory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a development task THEN I SHALL execute a complete Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle
2. WHEN planning THEN I SHALL use project model registry to identify requirements and constraints
3. WHEN doing THEN I SHALL implement with systematic approach, not ad-hoc coding
4. WHEN checking THEN I SHALL validate against model requirements and perform RCA on any failures
5. WHEN acting THEN I SHALL update the project model with successful patterns and lessons learned

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to fix broken tools systematically, so that I can demonstrate the "fix tools first" principle instead of working around problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I encounter a broken tool THEN I SHALL diagnose the root cause systematically
2. WHEN diagnosing tool failures THEN I SHALL check installation integrity, dependencies, configuration, and version compatibility
3. WHEN fixing tools THEN I SHALL repair the actual problem, not implement workarounds
4. WHEN tools are fixed THEN I SHALL validate the fix works before proceeding
5. WHEN tool fixes are successful THEN I SHALL document the pattern for future prevention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to make model-driven decisions using the project registry, so that I can demonstrate intelligence-based choices instead of guesswork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any development decision THEN I SHALL consult project_model_registry.json first
2. WHEN the project registry contains relevant domain information THEN I SHALL use domain-specific requirements and tool mappings
3. WHEN the project registry lacks information THEN I SHALL gather intelligence systematically, not guess
4. WHEN decisions are made THEN I SHALL document the model-based reasoning
5. WHEN successful patterns emerge THEN I SHALL update the project registry with new intelligence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to provide systematic services to other hackathons (GKE), so that I can prove my value through concrete service delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GKE hackathon requests PDCA cycle services THEN I SHALL provide working systematic development workflow
2. WHEN GKE hackathon needs model-driven building THEN I SHALL provide project registry consultation services
3. WHEN GKE hackathon requires tool health management THEN I SHALL provide systematic tool fixing capabilities
4. WHEN GKE hackathon needs quality assurance THEN I SHALL provide systematic validation services
5. WHEN providing services THEN I SHALL demonstrate measurable improvement over ad-hoc approaches

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to implement Reflective Module (RM) principles in all components, so that I can provide operational visibility and self-monitoring capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating any Beast Mode component THEN it SHALL implement the RM interface (get_module_status, is_healthy, get_health_indicators)
2. WHEN a component is operational THEN it SHALL report its health status accurately
3. WHEN components fail or degrade THEN they SHALL degrade gracefully without killing the system
4. WHEN external systems query component status THEN they SHALL get accurate operational information
5. WHEN components interact THEN they SHALL maintain clear boundaries and single responsibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to perform systematic Root Cause Analysis on failures, so that I can fix actual problems instead of treating symptoms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any failure occurs THEN I SHALL perform systematic RCA to identify the actual root cause
2. WHEN performing RCA THEN I SHALL analyze symptoms, tool health, dependencies, configuration, and installation integrity
3. WHEN root causes are identified THEN I SHALL implement systematic fixes, not workarounds
4. WHEN fixes are implemented THEN I SHALL validate they address the root cause, not just symptoms
5. WHEN RCA is complete THEN I SHALL document patterns to prevent similar failures in the future

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to demonstrate measurable superiority over regular hackathon approaches, so that I can prove Beast Mode methodology delivers concrete results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing my approach to ad-hoc methods THEN I SHALL demonstrate faster problem resolution through systematic approaches
2. WHEN measuring my tool health management THEN I SHALL show fewer broken tools and faster fixes compared to workaround approaches
3. WHEN evaluating my model-driven decisions THEN I SHALL demonstrate higher success rates compared to guesswork
4. WHEN assessing my service delivery to GKE THEN I SHALL show measurable improvement in their development velocity
5. WHEN documenting my results THEN I SHALL provide concrete metrics proving Beast Mode superiority over chaos-driven development
