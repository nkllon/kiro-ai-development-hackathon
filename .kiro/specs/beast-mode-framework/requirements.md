# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Beast Mode Framework is the core systematic development engine that powers the Kiro AI Development Hackathon project. It implements PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles with Root Cause Analysis (RCA), model-driven building using the project model registry, and Reflective Module (RM) principles. This framework serves as the foundation that enables systematic, high-percentage decision making over ad-hoc approaches, providing extended intelligence through proper tool usage and multi-perspective validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Beast Mode framework, I want systematic PDCA cycle implementation with integrated RCA, so that I can make high-percentage decisions based on available intelligence rather than guessing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a development task is initiated THEN the system SHALL enforce the PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)
2. WHEN the Check phase is executed THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for any failures or issues
3. WHEN making architectural decisions THEN the system SHALL consult the project model registry as the single source of truth
4. IF tools are broken or failing THEN the system SHALL fix the tools first rather than working around them
5. WHEN complex decisions are required THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters multi-perspective validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want model-driven building capabilities using the project model registry, so that I can make decisions based on the 165 requirements and 100 domains rather than assumptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting any work THEN the system SHALL load and consult project_model_registry.json first
2. WHEN identifying domain requirements THEN the system SHALL use the model's domain configurations and tool mappings
3. WHEN validating implementations THEN the system SHALL check against the model's requirements traceability
4. IF domain-specific tools exist THEN the system SHALL use them instead of generic tools
5. WHEN updating patterns THEN the system SHALL update the project model registry with new learnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to follow Reflective Module (RM) principles, so that I have operational visibility, self-monitoring, and proper architectural boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating any module THEN the system SHALL implement the RM interface (get_module_status, is_healthy, get_health_indicators)
2. WHEN a module is operational THEN it SHALL provide self-monitoring and health reporting capabilities
3. WHEN accessing module functionality THEN the system SHALL use external interfaces instead of implementation probing
4. IF a module fails or degrades THEN it SHALL implement graceful degradation without killing the system
5. WHEN modules interact THEN they SHALL maintain clear architectural boundaries with single responsibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation in the Check phase, so that I can ensure model compliance, RM compliance, tool integration, and architectural boundaries are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Check phase executes THEN the system SHALL perform C1: Model Compliance Check against project model requirements
2. WHEN validating modules THEN the system SHALL perform C2: RM Compliance Check for all Reflective Module interfaces
3. WHEN checking tools THEN the system SHALL perform C3: Tool Integration Check to verify all domain tools are working
4. WHEN validating architecture THEN the system SHALL perform C4: Architecture Boundaries Check for proper delegation and no direct file access
5. WHEN assessing quality THEN the system SHALL perform C5: Performance & Quality Check for regressions and module size limits
6. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL perform C6: Root Cause Analysis Check with systematic analysis
7. WHEN complex validation is needed THEN the system SHALL perform C7: Ghostbusters Multi-Perspective Validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want systematic Root Cause Analysis capabilities, so that I can identify actual root causes rather than symptoms and implement proper prevention measures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing RCA THEN the system SHALL analyze symptoms, tool health, dependency chains, and configuration issues
2. WHEN tool failures occur THEN the system SHALL check installation integrity, missing dependencies, configuration issues, and version compatibility
3. WHEN identifying root causes THEN the system SHALL use the RCA pattern library for common failure types
4. IF root causes are identified THEN the system SHALL generate recovery strategies and prevention measures
5. WHEN RCA is complete THEN the system SHALL update the project model with new patterns and prevention measures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with Ghostbusters multi-perspective analysis, so that I can get expert validation from Security, Code Quality, Test, and Build perspectives for complex decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN facing complex architectural decisions THEN the system SHALL call Ghostbusters for multi-perspective analysis
2. WHEN Ghostbusters analysis is performed THEN it SHALL emulate SecurityExpert, CodeQualityExpert, TestExpert, and BuildExpert perspectives
3. WHEN multi-perspective results are available THEN the system SHALL combine them with model validation for high-percentage decisions
4. IF future multi-agent system is implemented THEN the system SHALL support LangGraph/LangChain integration for true multi-agent orchestration
5. WHEN using Ghostbusters THEN the system SHALL maintain clean separation between multi-perspective analysis (current) and multi-agent system (future)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper tool usage hierarchy and decision framework, so that I can make high-percentage decisions with appropriate confidence levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making decisions with 80%+ confidence THEN the system SHALL use project model plus deterministic tools
2. WHEN making decisions with 50-80% confidence THEN the system SHALL add Ghostbusters multi-perspective validation
3. WHEN making decisions with <50% confidence THEN the system SHALL use full multi-perspective analysis plus model validation
4. WHEN using tools THEN the system SHALL follow the hierarchy: Project Model Tools → Domain-Specific Tools → Ghostbusters → Multi-Agent → Manual Analysis
5. IF manual analysis is required THEN the system SHALL provide full documentation of the decision process

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want continuous improvement capabilities, so that successful patterns are standardized and failures are systematically addressed for future prevention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementation is successful THEN the system SHALL document the approach and update the project model with new patterns
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL perform systematic root cause analysis and implement prevention measures
3. WHEN new patterns are discovered THEN the system SHALL create templates for similar future work
4. IF tools need updates THEN the system SHALL update tool mappings in the project model
5. WHEN improvements are made THEN the system SHALL validate no regressions are introduced and update documentation
