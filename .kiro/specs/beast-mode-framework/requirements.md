# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Beast Mode Framework transforms the Kiro AI Development Hackathon from a regular hackathon into a systematic domination engine. Unlike regular hackathons that rely on chaos and guesswork, Beast Mode uses systematic PDCA cycles, fixes broken tools instead of working around them, and makes model-driven decisions using the project registry's 165 requirements and 100 domains. The framework must provide concrete, measurable superiority over ad-hoc approaches and power other hackathons (GKE) through systematic services.

## Requirements

2. WHEN I encounter a broken tool THEN I SHALL fix it systematically rather than work around it
3. WHEN I make development decisions THEN I SHALL use project model registry data, not guesswork
4. WHEN GKE hackathon requests services THEN I SHALL provide working Beast Mode capabilities
5. WHEN measuring my performance THEN I SHALL demonstrate measurable superiority over ad-hoc approaches

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to fix broken tools systematically, so that I can demonstrate the "fix tools first" principle instead of working around problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I encounter a broken tool THEN I SHALL diagnose the root cause systematically
2. WHEN diagnosing tool failures THEN I SHALL check installation integrity, dependencies, configuration, and version compatibility

1. WHEN creating any Beast Mode component THEN it SHALL implement the RM interface (get_module_status, is_healthy, get_health_indicators)
2. WHEN a component is operational THEN it SHALL report its health status accurately
3. WHEN components fail or degrade THEN they SHALL degrade gracefully without killing the system
4. WHEN external systems query component status THEN they SHALL get accurate operational information
5. WHEN components interact THEN they SHALL maintain clear boundaries and single responsibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to perform systematic Root Cause Analysis on failures, so that I can fix actual problems instead of treating symptoms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any failure occurs THEN I SHALL perform systematic RCA to identify the actual root cause
2. WHEN performing RCA THEN I SHALL analyze symptoms, tool health, dependencies, configuration, and installation integrity
3. WHEN root causes are identified THEN I SHALL implement systematic fixes, not workarounds
4. WHEN fixes are implemented THEN I SHALL validate they address the root cause, not just symptoms
5. WHEN RCA is complete THEN I SHALL document patterns to prevent similar failures in the future

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode framework, I want to demonstrate measurable superiority over regular hackathon approaches, so that I can prove Beast Mode methodology delivers concrete results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing my approach to ad-hoc methods THEN I SHALL demonstrate faster problem resolution through systematic approaches
2. WHEN measuring my tool health management THEN I SHALL show fewer broken tools and faster fixes compared to workaround approaches
3. WHEN evaluating my model-driven decisions THEN I SHALL demonstrate higher success rates compared to guesswork
4. WHEN assessing my service delivery to GKE THEN I SHALL show measurable improvement in their development velocity
5. WHEN documenting my results THEN I SHALL provide concrete metrics proving Beast Mode superiority over chaos-driven development
