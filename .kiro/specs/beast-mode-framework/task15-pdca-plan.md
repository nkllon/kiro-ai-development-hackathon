#### 4. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**High Risks:**
1. **Performance Impact of Quality Gates**

   - *Risk*: Too many alerts reduce effectiveness
   - *Mitigation*: Smart alerting, escalation policies, noise reduction

3. **Complexity of Graceful Degradation**
   - *Risk*: Complex fallback logic introduces bugs
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing, simple fallback patterns

**Medium Risks:**

   - *Risk*: Team doesn't use ADR system consistently
   - *Mitigation*: Integration with development workflow, training

2. **Future-Proofing Over-Engineering**
   - *Risk*: Premature optimization for unknown requirements
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on proven patterns, iterative approach
