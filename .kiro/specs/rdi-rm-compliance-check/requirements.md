# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive compliance checking system for the Beast Mode Framework to validate RDI (Requirements-Design-Implementation) methodology adherence and RM (Reflective Module) architectural compliance. The system will systematically analyze the 4 commits ahead of main (including Phase 2 completion work) to ensure all components meet the established standards before integration. Based on the current status showing Phase 2 completion with 96.7% test coverage, this system will validate that the completed work maintains systematic development practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: RDI Compliance Validation

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Framework developer, I want to validate that all components follow RDI methodology, so that I can ensure systematic development practices are maintained across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a branch THEN the system SHALL validate that all requirements have corresponding design elements
2. WHEN analyzing a branch THEN the system SHALL validate that all design elements have corresponding implementation
3. WHEN analyzing a branch THEN the system SHALL validate that all implementations trace back to valid requirements
4. WHEN RDI violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation recommendations
5. WHEN RDI compliance is achieved THEN the system SHALL generate a compliance certificate

### Requirement 2: RM Architecture Compliance

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Framework architect, I want to validate that all modules implement the Reflective Module interface, so that I can ensure architectural consistency and health monitoring capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL validate that modules are â‰¤200 lines of code
2. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL validate that all RM interface methods are implemented
3. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL validate single responsibility principle adherence
4. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL validate health monitoring implementation
5. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL validate registry integration
6. WHEN RM violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific compliance guidance

### Requirement 3: Branch Analysis and Reporting

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to analyze the 4 commits ahead of main (Phase 2 completion work) for compliance issues, so that I can ensure quality gates are met before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the 4 commits ahead of main THEN the system SHALL identify all modified and new files since origin/master
2. WHEN analyzing Phase 2 completion work THEN the system SHALL validate against the 96.7% test coverage baseline
3. WHEN compliance issues are found THEN the system SHALL categorize issues by severity and reconcile against reported task completion status
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable remediation steps for the 7 failing tests identified
5. WHEN all compliance checks pass THEN the system SHALL approve the commits for merge to origin/master

### Requirement 4: Phase 2 Completion Validation

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Framework maintainer, I want to validate that Phase 2 completion meets all systematic development standards, so that I can ensure the foundation is solid for Phase 3.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating Phase 2 completion THEN the system SHALL verify all marked tasks are actually implemented
2. WHEN checking task completion status THEN the system SHALL reconcile marked complete tasks against actual code implementation
3. WHEN analyzing the 7 failing tests THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation guidance
4. WHEN validating RM compliance THEN the system SHALL check that all new components implement the Reflective Module interface
5. WHEN Phase 2 validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a readiness report for Phase 3 initiation

### Requirement 5: Integration with Beast Mode Ecosystem

**User Story:** As a Beast Mode Framework user, I want compliance checking integrated with existing tools, so that I can maintain workflow continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing Beast Mode tools THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with current workflows
2. WHEN compliance checks run THEN the system SHALL leverage existing health monitoring infrastructure
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL use established Beast Mode reporting formats
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL align with Beast Mode systematic methodology
5. WHEN compliance data is stored THEN the system SHALL use Beast Mode data models and storage patterns
