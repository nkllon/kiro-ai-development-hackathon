# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes comprehensive git management and DevOps best practices by extending the existing Ghostbusters framework with DevOps-focused agents and automation. It leverages the multi-agent system for automated code quality enforcement, security scanning, branch protection, pre-commit hooks, linting standards, and CI/CD pipeline integration. The system integrates Ghostbusters agents (SecurityExpert, CodeQualityExpert, BuildExpert, etc.) with git workflows to ensure code quality, security, and compliance while maintaining developer productivity through intelligent automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Ghostbusters-powered pre-commit hooks that intelligently detect and fix issues before they reach the repository, so that I can maintain high code quality with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer attempts to commit code THEN the system SHALL run Ghostbusters agents (SecurityExpert, CodeQualityExpert, TestExpert) to analyze and auto-fix issues
2. WHEN Ghostbusters detects delusions or issues THEN the system SHALL automatically apply recovery engines (SyntaxRecoveryEngine, IndentationFixer, ImportResolver) and re-validate
3. WHEN auto-fixes are successful THEN the system SHALL allow the commit to proceed with a summary of fixes applied
4. WHEN issues cannot be auto-fixed THEN the system SHALL prevent the commit and provide specific remediation guidance from the relevant expert agents
5. IF Ghostbusters framework is not configured THEN the system SHALL provide automated setup using the existing MultiDimensionalSmokeTest infrastructure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want branch protection rules on the main branch, so that all code changes go through proper review and validation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN someone attempts to push directly to the main branch THEN the system SHALL reject the push and require a pull request
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL require at least one code review approval before merging

2. WHEN SecurityExpert detects issues THEN the system SHALL integrate with GitGuardian for additional validation and automatically apply security fixes where possible
3. WHEN security delusions are detected THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters recovery engines to automatically remediate common security anti-patterns
4. WHEN manual intervention is required THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance from SecurityExpert with actionable remediation steps
5. WHEN GitGuardian and SecurityExpert results conflict THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters validation framework to resolve discrepancies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Ghostbusters CodeQualityExpert to intelligently manage code formatting and linting across the entire codebase, so that quality issues are automatically resolved with minimal disruption.

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run Ghostbusters CodeQualityExpert to detect syntax errors, indentation issues, and code quality patterns
2. WHEN quality delusions are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply IndentationFixer, SyntaxRecoveryEngine, and TypeAnnotationFixer as appropriate
3. WHEN multiple file types are present THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters file type detection to apply domain-specific quality rules and recovery engines
4. WHEN quality fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL validate functional equivalence using Ghostbusters validation framework to ensure zero false positives
5. WHEN conflicts arise between tools THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters multi-agent consensus to resolve configuration priorities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Ghostbusters BuildExpert and TestExpert to orchestrate intelligent CI/CD pipelines that automatically detect, analyze, and resolve build and test failures, so that deployments are reliable and self-healing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL run Ghostbusters BuildExpert to validate build configuration and TestExpert to analyze test coverage and detect failing tests
2. WHEN build or test delusions are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply recovery engines and re-run validation before proceeding with deployment
3. WHEN all Ghostbusters agents validate successfully THEN the system SHALL enable deployment with comprehensive confidence scoring and validation certificates
4. WHEN CI/CD processes fail THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters LangGraph orchestration to provide detailed failure analysis, root cause identification, and automated remediation suggestions
5. WHEN deployment validation is required THEN the system SHALL run the complete Ghostbusters workflow to ensure production readiness

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want Ghostbusters SecurityExpert and BuildExpert to intelligently manage dependencies and security vulnerabilities with automated remediation, so that the project stays secure and up-to-date without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are added or updated THEN the system SHALL run Ghostbusters SecurityExpert to scan for vulnerabilities and BuildExpert to validate dependency compatibility
2. WHEN vulnerable dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters recovery engines to automatically suggest and apply safe alternatives or updates
3. WHEN dependency delusions are identified THEN the system SHALL create automated pull requests with Ghostbusters-generated analysis, confidence scores, and validation results
4. WHEN license compatibility issues exist THEN the system SHALL use Ghostbusters multi-agent analysis to assess risk and provide specific remediation guidance
5. WHEN dependency updates require validation THEN the system SHALL run the complete Ghostbusters workflow to ensure functional equivalence and zero regression

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code coverage reporting and quality metrics, so that I can maintain high code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports and quality metrics
2. WHEN code coverage drops below configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL prevent merging and require additional tests
3. WHEN code complexity exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL flag functions or modules that need refactoring
4. WHEN quality metrics are generated THEN the system SHALL provide historical trends and improvement suggestions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a team member, I want standardized commit message formats and automated changelog generation, so that project history is clear and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commits are made THEN the system SHALL enforce conventional commit message formats (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
2. WHEN commit messages don't follow standards THEN the system SHALL reject the commit with format examples
3. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate changelogs from commit messages
4. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN the system SHALL clearly highlight them in release notes

### Requirement 9
