# Design Document

## Overview

The Git DevOps Pipeline feature extends the existing Beast Mode Ghostbusters framework with specialized DevOps agents and automation capabilities. It leverages the established multi-agent architecture, LangGraph orchestration, and reflective module patterns to provide intelligent git workflow management, automated code quality enforcement, and comprehensive CI/CD pipeline integration.

The system builds upon the existing `src/beast_mode/ghostbusters/` infrastructure and adds new DevOps-specific agents while integrating with external tools like GitGuardian, pre-commit hooks, and CI/CD platforms. The design follows the established Ghostbusters patterns of delusion detection, recovery engines, and multi-agent consensus building.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. DevOps Agent Framework
Extends the existing Ghostbusters agent system with DevOps-specific expertise:

- **DevOpsExpert**: New agent specializing in CI/CD workflows, deployment strategies, and infrastructure validation
- **GitWorkflowExpert**: Specialized agent for git operations, branch protection, and workflow automation
- **ComplianceExpert**: Agent focused on audit trails, regulatory requirements, and governance

#### 2. Git Integration Layer
Builds on the existing Beast Mode CLI framework to provide git-specific operations:

- **GitHookOrchestrator**: Manages pre-commit, pre-push, and post-merge hooks with Ghostbusters integration
- **BranchProtectionManager**: Enforces branch protection rules using multi-agent validation
- **CommitAnalyzer**: Analyzes commit messages, changes, and metadata using Ghostbusters agents

#### 3. CI/CD Orchestration Engine
Extends the existing orchestration patterns for DevOps workflows:

- **PipelineOrchestrator**: Coordinates CI/CD workflows using LangGraph state management
- **DeploymentValidator**: Uses multi-perspective validation for deployment decisions
- **EnvironmentManager**: Manages development, staging, and production environments

#### 4. Recovery and Remediation System
Extends existing recovery engines with DevOps-specific capabilities:

- **GitConfigRecoveryEngine**: Fixes git configuration issues
- **CIConfigRecoveryEngine**: Repairs CI/CD configuration problems
- **DependencyRecoveryEngine**: Resolves dependency conflicts and security issues

### Integration Points

#### Existing Ghostbusters Framework
- Leverages `MultiPerspectiveValidator` for deployment decisions
- Extends `ReflectiveModule` pattern for all new components
- Uses existing LangGraph orchestration infrastructure
- Integrates with Beast Mode CLI command structure

#### External Tool Integration
- **GitGuardian**: Integrated through SecurityExpert for secret detection
- **Pre-commit Framework**: Orchestrated through GitHookOrchestrator
- **CI/CD Platforms**: Abstracted through PipelineOrchestrator interface
- **Dependency Scanners**: Integrated through SecurityExpert and BuildExpert
