# Multi-Agent Consensus Engine Requirements

## Introduction

The Multi-Agent Consensus Engine provides systematic consensus mechanisms, confidence scoring, and decision orchestration for scenarios where multiple agents or systems provide conflicting analysis. This service focuses exclusively on consensus resolution without implementing specific domain agents or analysis capabilities.

**Single Responsibility:** Multi-agent consensus and confidence scoring only
**Architectural Position:** Foundational service with no dependencies

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consensus Mechanism Framework

**User Story:** As a multi-agent system, I want systematic consensus mechanisms, so that conflicting agent opinions can be resolved reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents provide conflicting analysis THEN the engine SHALL apply systematic consensus algorithms
2. WHEN consensus is reached THEN the engine SHALL provide the agreed-upon result with confidence metrics
3. WHEN consensus cannot be reached THEN the engine SHALL escalate to human review with detailed conflict analysis
4. WHEN consensus algorithms execute THEN they SHALL maintain audit trails of decision processes
5. WHEN new consensus patterns emerge THEN the engine SHALL learn and improve future consensus accuracy

### Requirement 2: Confidence Scoring System

**User Story:** As a multi-agent system, I want systematic confidence scoring, so that decision quality can be measured and validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents provide analysis THEN the engine SHALL calculate confidence scores based on systematic criteria
2. WHEN confidence scores are generated THEN they SHALL reflect analysis quality, consistency, and reliability
3. WHEN low confidence is detected THEN the engine SHALL trigger additional validation or human review
4. WHEN confidence patterns are established THEN they SHALL be used to improve future scoring accuracy
5. WHEN confidence thresholds are exceeded THEN the engine SHALL provide appropriate validation certificates

### Requirement 3: Decision Orchestration Framework

**User Story:** As a multi-agent system, I want decision orchestration capabilities, so that complex multi-agent workflows can be coordinated systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multi-agent decisions are required THEN the engine SHALL orchestrate agent coordination workflows
2. WHEN orchestration executes THEN it SHALL maintain state consistency across all participating agents
3. WHEN workflows fail THEN the engine SHALL provide graceful degradation and systematic error recovery
4. WHEN decisions complete THEN the engine SHALL provide comprehensive results with full audit trails
5. WHEN orchestration patterns succeed THEN they SHALL be reusable for similar future scenarios

### Requirement 4: Conflict Resolution System

**User Story:** As a multi-agent system, I want systematic conflict resolution, so that agent disagreements can be resolved without human intervention when possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent conflicts are detected THEN the engine SHALL classify conflict types and severity levels
2. WHEN resolvable conflicts occur THEN the engine SHALL apply appropriate resolution strategies automatically
3. WHEN complex conflicts arise THEN the engine SHALL provide structured escalation to human review
4. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the engine SHALL document resolution rationale and patterns
5. WHEN resolution strategies prove effective THEN they SHALL be learned for future conflict scenarios

## Derived Requirements (Non-Functional)

### Derived Requirement 1: Performance Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consensus is calculated THEN processing SHALL complete within 1 second for up to 10 agents
2. WHEN confidence scoring occurs THEN calculations SHALL complete within 500ms for standard scenarios
3. WHEN orchestration workflows execute THEN they SHALL complete within 5 seconds for typical multi-agent scenarios
4. WHEN concurrent consensus requests occur THEN the engine SHALL handle 100+ simultaneous operations
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the engine SHALL maintain core functionality with graceful degradation

### Derived Requirement 2: Reliability Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consensus operations execute THEN the engine SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime
2. WHEN failures occur THEN the engine SHALL preserve decision state and provide recovery mechanisms
3. WHEN invalid agent input is received THEN the engine SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN system load is high THEN core consensus functionality SHALL remain available
5. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the engine SHALL restore operations without data loss
