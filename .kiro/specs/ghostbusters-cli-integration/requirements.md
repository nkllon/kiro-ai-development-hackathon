# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Beast Mode CLI framework to include Ghostbusters functionality, providing command-line access to multi-perspective analysis, stakeholder validation, low-confidence decision analysis, and consensus building capabilities. The integration will leverage the existing CLI infrastructure while adding specialized commands for Ghostbusters operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze decisions with low confidence through the CLI, so that I can get multi-perspective insights without using a GUI interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters analyze "decision context" --confidence 0.3` THEN the system SHALL perform multi-perspective analysis on the provided decision context
2. WHEN the confidence level is below 0.5 THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger enhanced analysis with additional stakeholder perspectives
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display structured results including identified risks, alternative perspectives, and confidence metrics
4. IF the decision context is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message with usage examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to list and manage stakeholders through the CLI, so that I can ensure proper representation in decision analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters stakeholders --list` THEN the system SHALL display all configured stakeholders with their roles and expertise areas
2. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters stakeholders --add "name" --role "role" --expertise "area"` THEN the system SHALL add a new stakeholder to the system
3. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters stakeholders --remove "name"` THEN the system SHALL remove the specified stakeholder after confirmation
4. IF a stakeholder name already exists THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before updating

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to build consensus on decisions through the CLI, so that I can facilitate agreement without manual coordination overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters consensus "decision_id"` THEN the system SHALL initiate a consensus building process for the specified decision
2. WHEN consensus building starts THEN the system SHALL notify all relevant stakeholders and collect their input
3. WHEN all stakeholders have provided input THEN the system SHALL analyze convergence and display consensus metrics
4. IF consensus cannot be reached THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for resolution paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view Ghostbusters system status through the CLI, so that I can monitor the health and configuration of the analysis system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters status` THEN the system SHALL display current system health, active analyses, and configuration status
2. WHEN there are pending analyses THEN the system SHALL show their status and estimated completion times
3. WHEN system components are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL highlight issues with suggested remediation steps
4. IF no Ghostbusters processes are running THEN the system SHALL indicate the system is idle but ready

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Ghostbusters settings through the CLI, so that I can manage system behavior without editing configuration files directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters config --set "key=value"` THEN the system SHALL update the specified configuration parameter
2. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters config --get "key"` THEN the system SHALL display the current value of the specified parameter
3. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters config --list` THEN the system SHALL display all current configuration parameters with their values
4. IF an invalid configuration key is provided THEN the system SHALL display available configuration options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to validate decisions through the CLI, so that I can ensure decisions meet quality standards before implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters validate "decision_id"` THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive validation of the specified decision
2. WHEN validation includes quality checks THEN the system SHALL verify decision completeness, stakeholder coverage, and risk assessment
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL provide a validation certificate with timestamp and criteria met
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback on what needs to be addressed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export analysis results through the CLI, so that I can integrate Ghostbusters outputs with other tools and processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `beast-mode ghostbusters export "analysis_id" --format json` THEN the system SHALL export the analysis results in the specified format
2. WHEN export format is not specified THEN the system SHALL default to JSON format
3. WHEN I specify `--output "filename"` THEN the system SHALL save results to the specified file
4. IF the analysis ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return an error with available analysis IDs
