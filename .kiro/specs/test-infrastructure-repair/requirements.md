# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Beast Mode framework currently has 26 failed tests and 28 test errors, indicating significant issues with the test infrastructure and component interfaces. This feature will systematically repair the test suite to ensure all components are properly tested and the framework maintains high quality standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Beast Mode framework, I want all tests to pass consistently, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN all test fixtures SHALL be properly defined and available
2. WHEN tests reference component methods THEN those methods SHALL exist in the actual implementation
3. WHEN tests check component health THEN the health check methods SHALL return accurate status information
4. WHEN tests use enums THEN all referenced enum values SHALL be properly defined and accessible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing dependencies to be properly handled, so that tests can run in any environment without dependency-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require external dependencies THEN those dependencies SHALL be properly mocked or made optional
2. WHEN `psutil` is not available THEN tests SHALL either skip gracefully or use mock implementations
3. WHEN `concurrent.futures` is needed THEN it SHALL be properly imported and available
4. WHEN dependency issues occur THEN clear error messages SHALL guide resolution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component interfaces to be consistent between implementation and tests, so that tests accurately validate the actual behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call methods on intelligence engines THEN those methods SHALL exist in the actual implementation
2. WHEN tests expect specific attributes on safety managers THEN those attributes SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN tests check orchestrator capabilities THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide those capabilities
4. WHEN interface mismatches are detected THEN they SHALL be resolved by updating either implementation or tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component health monitoring to work correctly, so that I can identify and resolve system issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are initialized THEN their health status SHALL be accurately reported
2. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL return meaningful diagnostic information
3. WHEN components have dependencies THEN health checks SHALL verify dependency availability
4. WHEN health issues are detected THEN specific remediation guidance SHALL be provided

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test fixtures to be properly organized and reusable, so that test maintenance is efficient and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test classes need common setup THEN fixtures SHALL be defined in appropriate conftest.py files
2. WHEN multiple tests need the same mock objects THEN those mocks SHALL be provided as reusable fixtures
3. WHEN fixtures have dependencies THEN those dependencies SHALL be properly declared and resolved
4. WHEN fixture scope is important THEN appropriate scoping (function, class, module) SHALL be used

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enum definitions to be complete and consistent, so that all code can reliably reference status values and constants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests reference `AnalysisStatus.SUCCESS` THEN that enum value SHALL exist and be accessible
2. WHEN tests reference `AnalysisStatus.PARTIAL_SUCCESS` THEN that enum value SHALL exist and be accessible
3. WHEN new status values are needed THEN they SHALL be added to the appropriate enum definitions
4. WHEN enum values are used across modules THEN they SHALL be consistently imported and referenced
