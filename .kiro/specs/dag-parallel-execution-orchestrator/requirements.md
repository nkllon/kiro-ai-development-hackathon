# DAG Parallel Execution Orchestrator Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Parallel Execution Orchestrator that enables automatic parallel execution of tasks in Kiro specs. The orchestrator analyzes task dependencies, creates execution plans, and launches multiple Kiro agents to execute independent tasks simultaneously, dramatically reducing development time and maximizing resource utilization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DAG Dependency Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the orchestrator to automatically analyze task dependencies so that I can identify which tasks can run in parallel without manual coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a spec's tasks.md file THEN the system SHALL parse all task dependencies and create a dependency graph
2. WHEN tasks have no dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify them as parallel execution candidates
3. WHEN tasks depend on other tasks THEN the system SHALL create proper execution layers respecting dependencies
4. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL report the error and suggest fixes
5. WHEN dependency analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate a visual DAG representation

### Requirement 2: Parallel Execution Planning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the orchestrator to create optimal execution plans so that I can maximize parallel execution while respecting task dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating execution plans THEN the system SHALL group independent tasks into parallel execution batches
2. WHEN determining batch size THEN the system SHALL consider available resources and task complexity
3. WHEN planning execution THEN the system SHALL optimize for minimum total execution time
4. WHEN tasks have different estimated durations THEN the system SHALL balance workload across parallel agents
5. WHEN execution plans are created THEN the system SHALL provide time estimates and resource requirements

### Requirement 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the orchestrator to launch multiple Kiro agents automatically so that I can execute parallel tasks without manual coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN launching parallel execution THEN the system SHALL spawn multiple Kiro agent instances with proper isolation
2. WHEN agents are launched THEN each SHALL receive specific task assignments and branch parameters
3. WHEN agents execute tasks THEN the system SHALL monitor progress and handle failures gracefully
4. WHEN agents complete tasks THEN the system SHALL collect results and update the overall execution state
5. WHEN all tasks in a layer complete THEN the system SHALL automatically launch the next layer of parallel tasks

### Requirement 4: Branch and Workspace Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel agents to work in isolated environments so that they don't interfere with each other's work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN launching parallel agents THEN each SHALL work on a separate git branch to prevent conflicts
2. WHEN agents modify files THEN changes SHALL be isolated to their specific branch
3. WHEN agents complete tasks THEN their branches SHALL be automatically merged back to the main branch
4. WHEN merge conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them systematically using conflict resolution strategies
5. WHEN workspace isolation is needed THEN the system SHALL create separate working directories for each agent

### Requirement 5: Progress Monitoring and Coordination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time visibility into parallel execution progress so that I can monitor the overall development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parallel execution is running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates for all agents
2. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL update the overall DAG execution status
3. WHEN agents encounter errors THEN the system SHALL report failures and suggest remediation
4. WHEN execution stalls THEN the system SHALL detect deadlocks and provide resolution options
5. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive execution reports with timing and success metrics

### Requirement 6: Resource Management and Scaling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the orchestrator to manage computational resources efficiently so that parallel execution doesn't overwhelm the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining parallel agent count THEN the system SHALL consider available CPU, memory, and I/O resources
2. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL throttle parallel execution to prevent resource exhaustion
3. WHEN tasks require different resource profiles THEN the system SHALL schedule them appropriately
4. WHEN cloud resources are available THEN the system SHALL optionally scale execution to cloud environments
5. WHEN resource contention occurs THEN the system SHALL implement fair scheduling and priority management

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling so that parallel execution can recover from failures without losing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual agents fail THEN the system SHALL retry failed tasks automatically with exponential backoff
2. WHEN tasks fail repeatedly THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and continue with other parallel tasks
3. WHEN critical path tasks fail THEN the system SHALL pause dependent tasks and focus on recovery
4. WHEN recovery is impossible THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis and manual intervention options
5. WHEN execution resumes after failure THEN the system SHALL continue from the last successful checkpoint

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Kiro Workflows

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the orchestrator to integrate seamlessly with existing Kiro functionality so that I can use parallel execution without changing my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing specs THEN the orchestrator SHALL work with current task.md formats without modification
2. WHEN integrating with Kiro CLI THEN the system SHALL provide new commands for parallel execution
3. WHEN working with Kiro IDE THEN the system SHALL provide UI integration for monitoring parallel execution
4. WHEN using existing task status tracking THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with current status management
5. WHEN parallel execution completes THEN the results SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing Kiro workflows

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel execution to significantly reduce development time so that I can deliver features faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing tasks in parallel THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 50% reduction in total execution time for suitable workloads
2. WHEN optimizing execution plans THEN the system SHALL minimize idle time and maximize resource utilization
3. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching of task results and dependencies
4. WHEN tasks have common setup THEN the system SHALL optimize shared initialization across parallel agents
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics comparing parallel vs sequential execution

### Requirement 10: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure parallel execution behavior so that I can optimize it for my specific development environment and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring parallel execution THEN the system SHALL allow customization of agent count, resource limits, and execution strategies
2. WHEN setting execution preferences THEN the system SHALL support different parallelization strategies (CPU-bound, I/O-bound, mixed)
3. WHEN defining task priorities THEN the system SHALL allow manual override of automatic scheduling decisions
4. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for automated environments
5. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the system SHALL validate configuration and provide helpful error messages for invalid settings
