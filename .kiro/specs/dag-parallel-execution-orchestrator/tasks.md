# DAG Parallel Execution Orchestrator Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan creates a sophisticated DAG parallel execution system that transforms sequential task execution into coordinated parallel execution across multiple Kiro agents. The plan follows a systematic approach, building core dependency analysis first, then execution planning, agent management, and finally advanced coordination features.
