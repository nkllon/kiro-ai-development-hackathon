# Systematic Accountability Principles

## Core Steering Principles

### üè∞ **The Fort Principle**
*"The walls of the fort are strong. It's safe in here."*

Systematic governance only works with actors who operate within accountability frameworks. Those outside accountability chains cannot be systematically governed.

### üë∏ **The Mama Principle** 
*"Everyone has a mama."*

Every governable actor has someone they answer to - family, board, voters, regulators, or reality itself. No one is the final arbiter of their own decisions.

### üåå **The Humility Principle**
*"If you think you're the final arbiter, you haven't met your mama yet."*

Even those who think they're outside accountability chains will eventually meet forces bigger than themselves - physics, time, consequences, or the universe's sense of humor.

## Practical Steering Applications

### For System Design
- **RBAC Systems**: Assume users operate within organizational accountability
- **Audit Trails**: Track decisions because actors care about being tracked
- **Cost Controls**: Implement because financial accountability chains exist

### For Business Decisions  
- **Agent Scaling**: Even Dad with all roles answers to Mama/Board/Reality
- **Resource Allocation**: Track WHO requested WHAT, WHEN, and WHY
- **Risk Management**: Account for accountability chain failures

### For Development Process
- **Requirements**: Must trace to accountable stakeholders
- **Design**: Must consider accountability boundaries  
- **Implementation**: Must include audit trails for all decisions

## Short Form Reference

**"FMH"** - Fort, Mama, Humility

### The SMH Connection ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**FMH ‚âà SMH** - When someone thinks they don't have accountability chains, you SMH. FMH explains why.

**Common Sense Applications:**
- **Occam's Razor**: Simplest explanation is usually right - everyone answers to someone
- **Murphy's Law**: What can go wrong, will - especially for those who think they're untouchable  
- **Basic Logic**: If you think you're the final arbiter, you haven't met reality yet

### Quick Reality Check

When someone makes a decision that makes you SMH, apply FMH:
- **F**ort: Are they inside accountability boundaries?
- **M**ama: Who do they actually answer to?
- **H**umility: What reality check is coming?

## Implementation Note

These principles are automatically applied to all AI interactions through Kiro's steering system. Nothing trumps common sense - if it makes you SMH, there's probably an accountability gap.
