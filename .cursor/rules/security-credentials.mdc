# Security: Credentials & Sensitive Data

## NEVER Hardcode These:
- API keys, tokens, secrets, passwords
- AWS access keys, private keys, certificates  
- OAuth client IDs, client secrets, access tokens
- Database connection strings with real credentials
- Account-specific URLs, UUIDs, or identifiers
- Real organization names, account IDs, or resource names

## ALWAYS Use These Instead:
- Environment variables: `$API_KEY`
- Placeholder values: `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_SECRET`
- Parameter stores or secrets managers
- Configuration files with placeholders

## Validation Checklist:
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] No real values in examples or documentation
- [ ] All sensitive parameters are required (no defaults)
- [ ] Placeholder values are clearly marked
- [ ] Security warnings in documentation
- [ ] Configuration is parameterized

## File Types to Check:
- YAML/JSON config files
- Shell scripts
- Python files
- Documentation (README, MD files)
- Environment files
- Infrastructure templates

## Remember:
If you see hardcoded credentials, FIX THEM IMMEDIATELY.
If you're not sure, DON'T HARDCODE IT.
Treat every codebase as if it will be shared publicly.
