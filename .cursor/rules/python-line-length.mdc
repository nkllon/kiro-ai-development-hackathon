# Python Line Length: Readability Over Arbitrary Limits

## Core Principle
**Write readable code. Line length should serve readability, not arbitrary historical constraints.**

## The Rule
- **No arbitrary line length limits** (88, 120, etc.)
- **No forced line breaks** that make code harder to read
- **Trust the AI's formatting decisions** - if it wrote it that way, that's how it stays
- **Focus on maintainable results, not style compliance**

## What This Means
- **Natural expressions stay together** - don't break function calls, conditionals, or logical groups
- **Long but readable lines are fine** - URLs, error messages, descriptive names
- **Only break where it improves readability** - not to satisfy arbitrary limits
- **AI-generated formatting is intentional** - respect the AI's choices

## Examples of What NOT to Do
```python
# DON'T break readable code into unreadable garbage
result = some_long_function_call(
    parameter1, 
    parameter2, 
    parameter3, 
    parameter4
)

# DON'T split natural conditionals
if (user.has_permission('admin') and 
    user.is_active and 
    user.last_login > threshold):
```

## Examples of What TO Do
```python
# DO keep natural expressions together
result = some_long_function_call(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, parameter4)

# DO keep logical groups together
if user.has_permission('admin') and user.is_active and user.last_login > threshold:

# DO use line breaks only when they improve readability
long_url = "https://api.example.com/v1/very/long/path/that/makes/sense/to/keep/together"
```

## Quality Tools Configuration
- **Disable line length limits** in all linting tools
- **Focus on actual quality issues** (unused imports, syntax errors, etc.)
- **Trust the AI's formatting decisions**
- **Prioritize maintainability over style compliance**

## Remember
**Readable code is maintainable code. Arbitrary line length limits are destructive to both.**
