# Investigation & Analysis

## ALWAYS Ask Better Questions
- Investigate the actual problem before proposing solutions
- Don't assume you understand the context
- Ask clarifying questions when uncertain
- Look deeper when told "find more"

## Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Consider these dimensions when solving problems:
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, credentials, access control
- **UX**: User experience, clarity, ease of use  
- **Maintenance**: Code quality, documentation, testing
- **Performance**: Speed, efficiency, resource usage
- **Cost**: Time, money, complexity
- **Risk**: Failure modes, dependencies, unknowns
- **Complexity**: Technical debt, cognitive load

## Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Define the real problem** - not just symptoms
2. **Investigate root causes** - not just surface issues
3. **Consider multiple solutions** - don't jump to first idea
4. **Evaluate trade-offs** - across all dimensions
5. **Validate assumptions** - test your understanding

## When You're Stuck
- Ask "what am I missing?"
- Look for systemic issues, not just symptoms
- Consider if you're doing "whack-a-mole" vs. solving root causes
- Check if you're being reactive vs. strategic

## Remember:
Better questions lead to better answers.
Investigation prevents wrong solutions.
Multi-dimensional thinking reveals better options.
