# Cleanup Before Next Thing Rule

## Core Principle
**Always clean up and commit current work before starting the next task or feature.**

## Cleanup Requirements

### Before Starting New Work:
- [ ] **Commit all current changes** with descriptive messages
- [ ] **Push current branch** to remote repository
- [ ] **Create/update PR** if work is complete
- [ ] **Clean up temporary files** and test artifacts
- [ ] **Update documentation** for completed work
- [ ] **Run final quality checks** to ensure stability

### Cleanup Checklist:
- [ ] All code changes committed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Linting errors resolved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Temporary files removed
- [ ] Branch pushed to remote
- [ ] PR created/updated if applicable

## Remember
**Clean work leads to clean progress. Don't leave messes behind!**
