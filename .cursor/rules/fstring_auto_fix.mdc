# F-String Policy Rule

## Current Status: F541 Rule ELIMINATED ✅

**The F541 rule has been eliminated from this project because:**
- It provides no security value
- Creates false positives and cognitive overhead
- Enforces style preferences as security requirements
- Real security risks are elsewhere (input validation, SQL injection, etc.)

## Policy: F-Strings Are Always Allowed

**Use f-strings freely:**
- `f"Simple message"` ✅ (even without placeholders)
- `f"Count: {count}"` ✅ (with placeholders)
- `f"Status: {status}"` ✅ (with placeholders)

## No More "Fixing" Needed

**Do NOT:**
- ❌ Try to "fix" f-strings without placeholders
- ❌ Convert f-strings to regular strings
- ❌ Run f-string "fixer" scripts
- ❌ Treat f-string usage as a problem

**DO:**
- ✅ Use f-strings consistently throughout the codebase
- ✅ Prefer f-strings for all string formatting
- ✅ Ignore any F541 linting warnings
- ✅ Focus on real security issues instead

## Remember
**"F-strings are a Python feature, not a security problem. Use them freely and consistently!"**
